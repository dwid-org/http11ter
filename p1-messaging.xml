   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
   systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This document is Part 1 of the seven-part specification
   that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together,
   obsoletes RFC 2616.  Part 1 provides an overview of HTTP and
   its associated terminology, defines the "http" and "https" Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the generic message syntax
   and parsing requirements for HTTP message frames, and describes
   general security concerns for implementations.
</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and MIME-like
   message payloads for flexible interaction with network-based hypertext
   information systems. HTTP relies upon the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   standard <xref target="RFC3986"/> to indicate request targets and
   relationships between resources.
   Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet mail
   <xref target="RFC5322"/> and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   (MIME) <xref target="RFC2045"/> (see &diff2045entity; for the differences
   between HTTP and MIME messages).
</t>
<t>
   HTTP is a generic interface protocol for information systems. It is
   designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by presenting
   a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the types of
   resources provided. Likewise, servers do not need to be aware of each
   client's purpose: an HTTP request can be considered in isolation rather
   than being associated with a specific type of client or a predetermined
   sequence of application steps. The result is a protocol that can be used
   effectively in many different contexts and for which implementations can
   evolve independently over time.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP is also designed for use as a generic protocol for translating
   communication to and from other Internet information systems.
   HTTP proxies and gateways provide access to alternative information
   services by translating their diverse protocols into a hypertext
   format that can be viewed and manipulated by clients in the same way
   as HTTP services.
</t>
<t>
   One consequence of HTTP flexibility is that the protocol cannot be
   defined in terms of what occurs behind the interface. Instead, we
   are limited to defining the syntax of communication, the intent
   of received communication, and the expected behavior of recipients.
   If the communication is considered in isolation, then successful
   actions should be reflected in corresponding changes to the
   observable interface provided by servers. However, since multiple
   clients may act in parallel and perhaps at cross-purposes, we
   cannot require that such changes be observable beyond the scope
   of a single response.
</t>
<t>
   This document is Part 1 of the seven-part specification of HTTP,
   defining the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and obsoleting
   <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
   Part 1 describes the architectural elements that are used or
   referred to in HTTP and defines the URI schemes specific to
   HTTP-based resources, overall network operation, connection
   management, and HTTP message framing and forwarding requirements.
   Our goal is to define all of the mechanisms necessary for HTTP message
   handling that are independent of message semantics, thereby defining the
   complete set of requirements for message parsers and
   message-forwarding intermediaries.
</t>

<section title="Requirements" anchor="intro.requirements">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the &MUST; or &REQUIRED; level requirements for the protocols it
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the &MUST; or &REQUIRED;
   level and all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its protocols is said
   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the &MUST;
   level requirements but not all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its
   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

    A construct "#" is defined, similar to "*", for defining lists of

<section title="Basic Rules" anchor="basic.rules">
<t anchor="rule.CRLF">
  <x:anchor-alias value="CRLF"/>
   HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all
   protocol elements except the entity-body (see <xref target="tolerant.applications"/> for
   tolerant applications). The end-of-line marker within an entity-body
   is defined by its associated media type, as described in &media-types;.
</t>
<t anchor="rule.LWS">
   This specification uses three rules to denote the use of linear
   whitespace: OWS (optional whitespace), RWS (required whitespace), and
   BWS ("bad" whitespace). 
</t>
<t>
   The OWS rule is used where zero or more linear whitespace characters may
   appear. OWS &SHOULD; either not be produced or be produced as a single SP
   character. Multiple OWS characters that occur within field-content &SHOULD;
   be replaced with a single SP before interpreting the field value or
   forwarding the message downstream.
</t>
<t>
   RWS is used when at least one linear whitespace character is required to
   separate field tokens. RWS &SHOULD; be produced as a single SP character.
   Multiple RWS characters that occur within field-content &SHOULD; be
   replaced with a single SP before interpreting the field value or
   forwarding the message downstream.
</t>
<t>
   BWS is used where the grammar allows optional whitespace for historical
   reasons but senders &SHOULD-NOT; produce it in messages. HTTP/1.1
   recipients &MUST; accept such bad optional whitespace and remove it before
   interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.

<section title="HTTP architecture" anchor="architecture">
<t>
   HTTP was created with a specific architecture in mind, the World Wide Web,
   and has evolved over time to support the scalability needs of a worldwide
   hypertext system. Much of that architecture is reflected in the terminology
   and syntax productions used to define HTTP.

<section title="Uniform Resource Identifiers" anchor="uri">
<t>
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) <xref target="RFC3986"/> are used
   throughout HTTP as the means for identifying resources. URI references
   are used to target requests, redirect responses, and define relationships.
   HTTP does not limit what a resource may be; it merely defines an interface
   that can be used to interact with a resource via HTTP. More information on
   the scope of URIs and resources can be found in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.

   Each protocol element in HTTP that allows a URI reference will indicate in
   its ABNF production whether the element allows only a URI in absolute form
   (absolute-URI), any relative reference (relative-ref), or some other subset
   of the URI-reference grammar. Unless otherwise indicated, URI references
   are parsed relative to the request target (the default base URI for both
   the request and its corresponding response).

   If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics
   are that the identified resource is located at the server listening
   for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the request-target
   for the resource is path-absolute (<xref target="request-target"/>). The use of IP addresses
   in URLs &SHOULD; be avoided whenever possible (see <xref target="RFC1900"/>). If
   the path-absolute is not present in the URL, it &MUST; be given as "/" when
   used as a request-target for a resource (<xref target="request-target"/>). If a proxy
   receives a host name which is not a fully qualified domain name, it
   &MAY; add its domain to the host name it received. If a proxy receives
   a fully qualified domain name, the proxy &MUST-NOT; change the host
   name.

<section title="URI Comparison" anchor="uri.comparison">

   When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not, a client

  <list style="symbols">
    <t>A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default

<section title="Overall Operation" anchor="intro.overall.operation">
<t>
   HTTP is a request/response protocol. A client sends a
   request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and
   protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request
   modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a
   connection with a server. The server responds with a status line,
   including the message's protocol version and a success or error code,
   followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity
   metainformation, and possible entity-body content.
</t>
<t>
   Most HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of
   a request to be applied to a resource on some origin server. In the
   simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v)
   between the user agent (UA) and the origin server (O).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="drawing">
       request chain ------------------------&gt;
    UA -------------------v------------------- O
       &lt;----------------------- response chain
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries
   are present in the request/response chain. There are three common
   forms of intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a
   forwarding agent, receiving requests for a URI in its absolute form,
   rewriting all or part of the message, and forwarding the reformatted
   request toward the server identified by the URI. A gateway is a
   receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s) and, if
   necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server's
   protocol. A tunnel acts as a relay point between two connections
   without changing the messages; tunnels are used when the
   communication needs to pass through an intermediary (such as a
   firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand the contents
   of the messages.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="drawing">
       request chain --------------------------------------&gt;
    UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O
       &lt;------------------------------------- response chain
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the
   user agent and origin server. A request or response message that
   travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections.
   This distinction is important because some HTTP communication options
   may apply only to the connection with the nearest, non-tunnel
   neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections
   along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each participant may
   be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B
   may be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or
   forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it
   is handling A's request.
</t>
<t>
   Any party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may
   employ an internal cache for handling requests. The effect of a cache
   is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the
   participants along the chain has a cached response applicable to that
   request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a
   cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request which
   has not been cached by UA or A.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="drawing">
          request chain ----------&gt;
       UA -----v----- A -----v----- B - - - - - - C - - - - - - O
          &lt;--------- response chain
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Not all responses are usefully cacheable, and some requests may
   contain modifiers which place special requirements on cache behavior.
   HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are
   defined in &caching;.
</t>
<t>
   In fact, there are a wide variety of architectures and configurations
   of caches and proxies currently being experimented with or deployed
   across the World Wide Web. These systems include national hierarchies
   of proxy caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that
   broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that distribute
   subsets of cached data via CD-ROM, and so on. HTTP systems are used
   in corporate intranets over high-bandwidth links, and for access via
   PDAs with low-power radio links and intermittent connectivity. The
   goal of HTTP/1.1 is to support the wide diversity of configurations
   already deployed while introducing protocol constructs that meet the
   needs of those who build web applications that require high
   reliability and, failing that, at least reliable indications of
   failure.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The
   default port is TCP 80 (<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers"/>), but other ports can be used. This does
   not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol
   on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable
   transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;
   the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the
   transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope
   of this specification.
</t>
<t>
   In HTTP/1.0, most implementations used a new connection for each
   request/response exchange. In HTTP/1.1, a connection may be used for
   one or more request/response exchanges, although connections may be
   closed for a variety of reasons (see <xref target="persistent.connections"/>).

<t>
   HTTP uses a "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" numbering scheme to indicate versions
   of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow
   the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for
   understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features
   obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version
   number for the addition of message components which do not affect
   communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.
   The &lt;minor&gt; number is incremented when the changes made to the
   protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing
   algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply
   additional capabilities of the sender. The &lt;major&gt; number is
   incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is
   changed. See <xref target="RFC2145"/> for a fuller explanation.
</t>
<t>
   The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
   in the first line of the message. HTTP-Version is case-sensitive.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="HTTP-Version"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="HTTP-Prot-Name"/>

  <x:ref>HTTP-Prot-Name</x:ref> = <x:abnf-char-sequence>"HTTP"</x:abnf-char-sequence> ; "HTTP", case-sensitive 
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Note that the major and minor numbers &MUST; be treated as separate
   integers and that each &MAY; be incremented higher than a single digit.
   Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is
   lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros &MUST; be ignored by recipients and
   &MUST-NOT; be sent.
</t>
<t>
   An application that sends a request or response message that includes
   HTTP-Version of "HTTP/1.1" &MUST; be at least conditionally compliant
   with this specification. Applications that are at least conditionally
   compliant with this specification &SHOULD; use an HTTP-Version of
   "HTTP/1.1" in their messages, and &MUST; do so for any message that is
   not compatible with HTTP/1.0. For more details on when to send
   specific HTTP-Version values, see <xref target="RFC2145"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The HTTP version of an application is the highest HTTP version for
   which the application is at least conditionally compliant.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy and gateway applications need to be careful when forwarding
   messages in protocol versions different from that of the application.
   Since the protocol version indicates the protocol capability of the
   sender, a proxy/gateway &MUST-NOT; send a message with a version
   indicator which is greater than its actual version. If a higher
   version request is received, the proxy/gateway &MUST; either downgrade
   the request version, or respond with an error, or switch to tunnel
   behavior.
</t>
<t>
   Due to interoperability problems with HTTP/1.0 proxies discovered
   since the publication of <xref target="RFC2068"/>, caching proxies &MUST;, gateways
   &MAY;, and tunnels &MUST-NOT; upgrade the request to the highest version
   they support. The proxy/gateway's response to that request &MUST; be in
   the same major version as the request.
</t>
<x:note>

<section title="Date/Time Formats: Full Date" anchor="date.time.formats.full.date">
  <x:anchor-alias value="HTTP-date"/>
<t>
   HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
   for the representation of date/time stamps:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; obsolete RFC 850 format
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents
   a fixed-length subset of that defined by <xref target="RFC1123"/>. The
   other formats are described here only for
   compatibility with obsolete implementations.
   HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value &MUST; accept
   all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they &MUST;
   only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
   in header fields. See <xref target="tolerant.applications"/> for further information.
</t>
<t>
   All HTTP date/time stamps &MUST; be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
   (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
   equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
   first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
   abbreviation for time zone, and &MUST; be assumed when reading the
   asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and &MUST-NOT; include
   additional whitespace beyond that specifically included as SP in the
   grammar.

<t>
   Transfer-coding values are used to indicate an encoding
   transformation that has been, can be, or may need to be applied to an
   entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.
   This differs from a content coding in that the transfer-coding is a
   property of the message, not of the original entity.

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   transfer-coding values in the TE header field (<xref target="header.te"/>) and in
   the Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Whenever a transfer-coding is applied to a message-body, the set of
   transfer-codings &MUST; include "chunked", unless the message indicates it
   is terminated by closing the connection. When the "chunked" transfer-coding
   is used, it &MUST; be the last transfer-coding applied to the
   message-body. The "chunked" transfer-coding &MUST-NOT; be applied more
   than once to a message-body. These rules allow the recipient to
   determine the transfer-length of the message (<xref target="message.length"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Transfer-codings are analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding
   values of MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/>, which were designed to enable safe transport of
   binary data over a 7-bit transport service. However, safe transport
   has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol. In HTTP,
   the only unsafe characteristic of message-bodies is the difficulty in
   determining the exact body length (<xref target="message.length"/>), or the desire to
   encrypt data over a shared transport.
</t>
<t>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
   following tokens: "chunked" (<xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding"/>),
   "gzip", "compress", and "deflate" (&content-codings;).
</t>
<t>
   New transfer-coding value tokens &SHOULD; be registered in the same way
   as new content-coding value tokens (&content-codings;).
</t>
<t>
   A server which receives an entity-body with a transfer-coding it does
   not understand &SHOULD; return 501 (Not Implemented), and close the
   connection. A server &MUST-NOT; send transfer-codings to an HTTP/1.0
   client.

   The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an &OPTIONAL; trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.

<t>
   The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk-data in octets. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.
</t>
<t>
   The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header
   fields at the end of the message. The Trailer header field can be
   used to indicate which header fields are included in a trailer (see
   <xref target="header.trailer"/>).
</t>
<t>
   A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response &MUST-NOT; use the
   trailer for any header fields unless at least one of the following is
   true:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>the request included a TE header field that indicates "trailers" is
     acceptable in the transfer-coding of the  response, as described in
     <xref target="header.te"/>; or,</t>

    <t>the server is the origin server for the response, the trailer
     fields consist entirely of optional metadata, and the recipient
     could use the message (in a manner acceptable to the origin server)
     without receiving this metadata.  In other words, the origin server
     is willing to accept the possibility that the trailer fields might
     be silently discarded along the path to the client.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This requirement prevents an interoperability failure when the
   message is being received by an HTTP/1.1 (or later) proxy and
   forwarded to an HTTP/1.0 recipient. It avoids a situation where
   compliance with the protocol would have necessitated a possibly
   infinite buffer on the proxy.
</t>
<t>
   A process for decoding the "chunked" transfer-coding
   can be represented in pseudo-code as:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="code">
  length := 0
  read chunk-size, chunk-ext (if any) and CRLF

<t>
   Product tokens are used to allow communicating applications to
   identify themselves by software name and version. Most fields using
   product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part
   of the application to be listed, separated by whitespace. By
   convention, the products are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.

<t>
   Product tokens &SHOULD; be short and to the point. They &MUST-NOT; be
   used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any
   token character &MAY; appear in a product-version, this token &SHOULD;
   only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of

   Both transfer codings (TE request header, <xref target="header.te"/>)

   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters.  A weight is normalized to a real number in
   the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum
   value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with
   this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1
   applications &MUST-NOT; generate more than three digits after the
   decimal point. User configuration of these values &SHOULD; also be
   limited in this fashion.

<t>
   Request (<xref target="request"/>) and Response (<xref target="response"/>) messages use the generic
   message format of <xref target="RFC5322"/> for transferring entities (the payload
   of the message). Both types of message consist of a start-line, zero
   or more header fields (also known as "headers"), an empty line (i.e.,
   a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the
   header fields, and possibly a message-body.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="generic-message"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="start-line"/>

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   In the interest of robustness, servers &SHOULD; ignore any empty
   line(s) received where a Request-Line is expected. In other words, if
   the server is reading the protocol stream at the beginning of a
   message and receives a CRLF first, it should ignore the CRLF.
</t>
<t>
   Certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate extra CRLF's
   after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly forbidden by the
   BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client &MUST-NOT; preface or follow a request with an
   extra CRLF.
</t>
<t>
   Whitespace (WSP) &MUST-NOT; be sent between the start-line and the first
   header field. The presence of whitespace might be an attempt to trick a
   noncompliant implementation of HTTP into ignoring that field or processing
   the next line as a new request, either of which may result in security
   issues when implementations within the request chain interpret the
   same message differently. HTTP/1.1 servers &MUST; reject such a message
   with a 400 (Bad Request) response.

   HTTP header fields follow the same general format as Internet messages in
   <xref target="RFC5322" x:fmt="of" x:sec="2.1"/>. Each header field consists
   of a name followed by a colon (":"), optional whitespace, and the field
   value. Field names are case-insensitive.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="message-header"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-name"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-value"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="field-content"/>

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Historically, HTTP has allowed field-content with text in the ISO-8859-1
   <xref target="ISO-8859-1"/> character encoding (allowing other character sets
   through use of <xref target="RFC2047"/> encoding). In practice, most HTTP
   header field-values use only a subset of the US-ASCII charset
   <xref target="USASCII"/>. Newly defined header fields &SHOULD; constrain
   their field-values to US-ASCII characters. Recipients &SHOULD; treat other
   (obs-text) octets in field-content as opaque data.
</t>
<t>
   No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon. For
   security reasons, any request message received containing such whitespace
   &MUST; be rejected with a response code of 400 (Bad Request) and any such
   whitespace in a response message &MUST; be removed.
</t>
<t>
   The field value &MAY; be preceded by optional whitespace; a single SP is
   preferred. The field-value does not include any leading or trailing white
   space: OWS occurring before the first non-whitespace character of the
   field-value or after the last non-whitespace character of the field-value
   is ignored and &MAY; be removed without changing the meaning of the header
   field.
</t>
<t>
   Historically, HTTP header field values could be extended over multiple
   lines by preceding each extra line with at least one space or horizontal
   tab character (line folding). This specification deprecates such line
   folding except within the message/http media type
   (<xref target="internet.media.type.message.http"/>).
   HTTP/1.1 senders &MUST-NOT; produce messages that include line folding
   (i.e., that contain any field-content that matches the obs-fold rule) unless
   the message is intended for packaging within the message/http media type.
   HTTP/1.1 recipients &SHOULD; accept line folding and replace any embedded
   obs-fold whitespace with a single SP prior to interpreting the field value
   or forwarding the message downstream.
</t>
<t anchor="rule.comment">
  <x:anchor-alias value="comment"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="ctext"/>
   Comments can be included in some HTTP header fields by surrounding
   the comment text with parentheses. Comments are only allowed in
   fields containing "comment" as part of their field value definition.
   In all other fields, parentheses are considered part of the field
   value.

<t>
   The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant. However, it is "good practice" to send
   general-header fields first, followed by request-header or response-header
   fields, and ending with the entity-header fields.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name &MAY; be
   present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that
   header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].
   It &MUST; be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one
   "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the
   message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each
   separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same
   field-name are received is therefore significant to the
   interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy &MUST-NOT;
   change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.

<section title="Message Body" anchor="message.body">
  <x:anchor-alias value="message-body"/>
<t>
   The message-body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the
   entity-body associated with the request or response. The message-body
   differs from the entity-body only when a transfer-coding has been
   applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="message-body"/>
  <x:ref>message-body</x:ref> = <x:ref>entity-body</x:ref>
               / &lt;entity-body encoded as per <x:ref>Transfer-Encoding</x:ref>&gt;
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Transfer-Encoding &MUST; be used to indicate any transfer-codings
   applied by an application to ensure safe and proper transfer of the
   message. Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the
   entity, and thus &MAY; be added or removed by any application along the
   request/response chain. (However, <xref target="transfer.codings"/> places restrictions on
   when certain transfer-codings may be used.)
</t>
<t>
   The rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for
   requests and responses.
</t>
<t>
   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the request's message-headers. A message-body &MUST-NOT; be included in
   a request if the specification of the request method (&method;)
   explicitly disallows an entity-body in requests.
   When a request message contains both a message-body of non-zero
   length and a method that does not define any semantics for that
   request message-body, then an origin server &SHOULD; either ignore
   the message-body or respond with an appropriate error message
   (e.g., 413).  A proxy or gateway, when presented the same request,
   &SHOULD; either forward the request inbound with the message-body or
   ignore the message-body when determining a response.
</t>
<t>
   For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with
   a message is dependent on both the request method and the response
   status code (<xref target="status.code.and.reason.phrase"/>). All responses to the HEAD request method
   &MUST-NOT; include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-header
   fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx
   (informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified) responses
   &MUST-NOT; include a message-body. All other responses do include a
   message-body, although it &MAY; be of zero length.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Message Length" anchor="message.length">
<t>
   The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body as
   it appears in the message; that is, after any transfer-codings have
   been applied. When a message-body is included with a message, the
   transfer-length of that body is determined by one of the following
   (in order of precedence):
</t>
<t>
  <list style="numbers">
    <x:lt><t>
     Any response message which "&MUST-NOT;" include a message-body (such
     as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD
     request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the
     header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in
     the message.
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If a Transfer-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.transfer-encoding"/>)
     is present and the "chunked" transfer-coding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>)
     is used, the transfer-length is defined by the use of this transfer-coding.
     If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present and the "chunked" transfer-coding
     is not present, the transfer-length is defined by the sender closing the connection. 
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If a Content-Length header field (<xref target="header.content-length"/>) is present, its
     value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the
     transfer-length. The Content-Length header field &MUST-NOT; be sent
     if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding
     header field is present). If a message is received with both a
     Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field,
     the latter &MUST; be ignored.
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     If the message uses the media type "multipart/byteranges", and the
     transfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this self-delimiting
     media type defines the transfer-length. This media type
     &MUST-NOT; be used unless the sender knows that the recipient can parse
     it; the presence in a request of a Range header with multiple byte-range
     specifiers from a 1.1 client implies that the client can parse
     multipart/byteranges responses.
    <list style="empty"><t>
       A range header might be forwarded by a 1.0 proxy that does not
       understand multipart/byteranges; in this case the server &MUST;
       delimit the message using methods defined in items 1, 3 or 5 of
       this section.
    </t></list>
    </t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>
     By the server closing the connection. (Closing the connection
     cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body, since that
     would leave no possibility for the server to send back a response.)
    </t></x:lt>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests
   containing a message-body &MUST; include a valid Content-Length header
   field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a
   request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,
   the server &SHOULD; respond with 400 (Bad Request) if it cannot
   determine the length of the message, or with 411 (Length Required) if
   it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.
</t>
<t>
   All HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities &MUST; accept the
   "chunked" transfer-coding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>), thus allowing this mechanism
   to be used for messages when the message length cannot be determined
   in advance.
</t>
<t>
   Messages &MUST-NOT; include both a Content-Length header field and a
   transfer-coding. If the message does include a
   transfer-coding, the Content-Length &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<t>
   When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body is
   allowed, its field value &MUST; exactly match the number of OCTETs in
   the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents &MUST; notify the user when an
   invalid length is received and detected.
</t>
</section>

<section title="General Header Fields" anchor="general.header.fields">
  <x:anchor-alias value="general-header"/>
<t>
   There are a few header fields which have general applicability for
   both request and response messages, but which do not apply to the
   entity being transferred. These header fields apply only to the
   message being transmitted.
</t>

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   General-header field names can be extended reliably only in
   combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
   experimental header fields may be given the semantics of general
   header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to
   be general-header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as
   entity-header fields.

                 / <x:ref>authority</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The four options for request-target are dependent on the nature of the
   request. The asterisk "*" means that the request does not apply to a
   particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed
   when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. One
   example would be
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The absolute-URI form is &REQUIRED; when the request is being made to a
   proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it
   from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy &MAY;
   forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server
   specified by the absolute-URI. In order to avoid request loops, a
   proxy &MUST; be able to recognize all of its server names, including
   any aliases, local variations, and the numeric IP address. An example
   Request-Line would be:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  GET http://www.example.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   To allow for transition to absolute-URIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers &MUST; accept the absolute-URI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.
</t>
<t>
   The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method (&CONNECT;).
</t>
<t>
   The most common form of request-target is that used to identify a
   resource on an origin server or gateway. In this case the absolute
   path of the URI &MUST; be transmitted (see <xref target="http.uri"/>, path-absolute) as
   the request-target, and the network location of the URI (authority) &MUST;
   be transmitted in a Host header field. For example, a client wishing
   to retrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would
   create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.example.org" and send
   the lines:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.org
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   followed by the remainder of the Request. Note that the absolute path
   cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it &MUST; be
   given as "/" (the server root).
</t>
<t>
   If a proxy receives a request without any path in the request-target and
   the method specified is capable of supporting the asterisk form of
   request-target, then the last proxy on the request chain &MUST; forward the
   request with "*" as the final request-target.
</t>
<figure><preamble>   
   For example, the request
</preamble><artwork type="example">
  OPTIONS http://www.example.org:8001 HTTP/1.1
</artwork></figure>
<figure><preamble>   
  would be forwarded by the proxy as
</preamble><artwork type="example">
  OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.org:8001
</artwork>
<postamble>
   after connecting to port 8001 of host "www.example.org".
</postamble>
</figure>
<t>
   The request-target is transmitted in the format specified in 
   <xref target="http.uri"/>. If the request-target is percent-encoded
   (<xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="2.1"/>), the origin server
   &MUST; decode the request-target in order to
   properly interpret the request. Servers &SHOULD; respond to invalid
   request-targets with an appropriate status code.
</t>
<t>
   A transparent proxy &MUST-NOT; rewrite the "path-absolute" part of the
   received request-target when forwarding it to the next inbound server,
   except as noted above to replace a null path-absolute with "/".
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> The "no rewrite" rule prevents the proxy from changing the
    meaning of the request when the origin server is improperly using
    a non-reserved URI character for a reserved purpose.  Implementors
    should be aware that some pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies have been known to
    rewrite the request-target.
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   HTTP does not place a pre-defined limit on the length of a request-target.
   A server &MUST; be prepared to receive URIs of unbounded length and
   respond with the 414 (URI Too Long) status if the received
   request-target would be longer than the server wishes to handle
   (see &status-414;).
</t>
<t>
   Various ad-hoc limitations on request-target length are found in practice.
   It is &RECOMMENDED; that all HTTP senders and recipients support
   request-target lengths of 8000 or more OCTETs.

<section title="Persistent Connections" anchor="persistent.connections">

<section title="Purpose" anchor="persistent.purpose">
<t>
   Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection was
   established to fetch each URL, increasing the load on HTTP servers
   and causing congestion on the Internet. The use of inline images and
   other associated data often require a client to make multiple
   requests of the same server in a short amount of time. Analysis of
   these performance problems and results from a prototype
   implementation are available <xref target="Pad1995"/> <xref target="Spe"/>. Implementation experience and
   measurements of actual HTTP/1.1 implementations show good
   results <xref target="Nie1997"/>. Alternatives have also been explored, for example,
   T/TCP <xref target="Tou1998"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Persistent HTTP connections have a number of advantages:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time is saved
        in routers and hosts (clients, servers, proxies, gateways,
        tunnels, or caches), and memory used for TCP protocol control
        blocks can be saved in hosts.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection.
        Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without
        waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to
        be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Network congestion is reduced by reducing the number of packets
        caused by TCP opens, and by allowing TCP sufficient time to
        determine the congestion state of the network.
      </t>
      <t>
        Latency on subsequent requests is reduced since there is no time
        spent in TCP's connection opening handshake.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP can evolve more gracefully, since errors can be reported
        without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. Clients using
        future versions of HTTP might optimistically try a new feature,
        but if communicating with an older server, retry with old
        semantics after an error is reported.
      </t>

   HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any
   HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client
   &SHOULD; assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection,
   even after error responses from the server.
</t>
<t>
   Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a
   server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes
   place using the Connection header field (<xref target="header.connection"/>). Once a close
   has been signaled, the client &MUST-NOT; send any more requests on that
   connection.
</t>

<section title="Negotiation" anchor="persistent.negotiation">
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 server &MAY; assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to
   maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including
   the connection-token "close" was sent in the request. If the server
   chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the
   response, it &SHOULD; send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 client &MAY; expect a connection to remain open, but would
   decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server
   contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case
   the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that
   request, it &SHOULD; send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</t>
<t>
   If either the client or the server sends the close token in the
   Connection header, that request becomes the last one for the
   connection.
</t>
<t>
   Clients and servers &SHOULD-NOT;  assume that a persistent connection is
   maintained for HTTP versions less than 1.1 unless it is explicitly
   signaled. See <xref target="compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections"/> for more information on backward
   compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.
</t>
<t>
   In order to remain persistent, all messages on the connection &MUST;
   have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure
   of the connection), as described in <xref target="message.length"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Pipelining" anchor="pipelining">
<t>
   A client that supports persistent connections &MAY; "pipeline" its
   requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each
   response). A server &MUST; send its responses to those requests in the
   same order that the requests were received.
</t>
<t>
   Clients which assume persistent connections and pipeline immediately
   after connection establishment &SHOULD; be prepared to retry their
   connection if the first pipelined attempt fails. If a client does
   such a retry, it &MUST-NOT; pipeline before it knows the connection is
   persistent. Clients &MUST; also be prepared to resend their requests if
   the server closes the connection before sending all of the
   corresponding responses.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD-NOT;  pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or
   non-idempotent sequences of methods (see &idempotent-methods;). Otherwise, a
   premature termination of the transport connection could lead to
   indeterminate results. A client wishing to send a non-idempotent
   request &SHOULD; wait to send that request until it has received the
   response status for the previous request.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Proxy Servers" anchor="persistent.proxy">
<t>
   It is especially important that proxies correctly implement the
   properties of the Connection header field as specified in <xref target="header.connection"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The proxy server &MUST; signal persistent connections separately with
   its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it
   connects to. Each persistent connection applies to only one transport
   link.
</t>
<t>
   A proxy server &MUST-NOT; establish a HTTP/1.1 persistent connection
   with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see <xref x:sec="19.7.1" x:fmt="of" target="RFC2068"/>
   for information and discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header
   implemented by many HTTP/1.0 clients).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Practical Considerations" anchor="persistent.practical">
<t>
   Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.
</t>
<t>
   When a client or server wishes to time-out it &SHOULD; issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers &SHOULD; both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.
</t>
<t>
   A client, server, or proxy &MAY; close the transport connection at any
   time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request
   at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle"
   connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being
   closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a
   request is in progress.
</t>
<t>
   This means that clients, servers, and proxies &MUST; be able to recover
   from asynchronous close events. Client software &SHOULD; reopen the
   transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests
   without user interaction so long as the request sequence is
   idempotent (see &idempotent-methods;). Non-idempotent methods or sequences
   &MUST-NOT; be automatically retried, although user agents &MAY; offer a
   human operator the choice of retrying the request(s). Confirmation by
   user-agent software with semantic understanding of the application
   &MAY; substitute for user confirmation. The automatic retry &SHOULD-NOT; 
   be repeated if the second sequence of requests fails.
</t>
<t>
   Servers &SHOULD; always respond to at least one request per connection,
   if at all possible. Servers &SHOULD-NOT;  close a connection in the
   middle of transmitting a response, unless a network or client failure
   is suspected.
</t>
<t>
   Clients that use persistent connections &SHOULD; limit the number of
   simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A
   single-user client &SHOULD-NOT; maintain more than 2 connections with
   any server or proxy. A proxy &SHOULD; use up to 2*N connections to
   another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously
   active users. These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response
   times and avoid congestion.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Message Transmission Requirements" anchor="message.transmission.requirements">

<section title="Persistent Connections and Flow Control" anchor="persistent.flow">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 servers &SHOULD; maintain persistent connections and use TCP's
   flow control mechanisms to resolve temporary overloads, rather than
   terminating connections with the expectation that clients will retry.
   The latter technique can exacerbate network congestion.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Monitoring Connections for Error Status Messages" anchor="persistent.monitor">
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 (or later) client sending a message-body &SHOULD; monitor
   the network connection for an error status while it is transmitting
   the request. If the client sees an error status, it &SHOULD;
   immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent
   using a "chunked" encoding (<xref target="transfer.codings"/>), a zero length chunk and
   empty trailer &MAY; be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.
   If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client &MUST;
   close the connection.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Use of the 100 (Continue) Status" anchor="use.of.the.100.status">
<t>
   The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see &status-100;) is to
   allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
   to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
   (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
   body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
   inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
   the message without looking at the body.
</t>
<t>
   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
        If a client will wait for a 100 (Continue) response before
        sending the request body, it &MUST; send an Expect request-header
        field (&header-expect;) with the "100-continue" expectation.
    </t>
    <t>
        A client &MUST-NOT; send an Expect request-header field (&header-expect;)
        with the "100-continue" expectation if it does not intend
        to send a request body.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows
   ambiguous situations in which a client may send "Expect: 100-continue"
   without receiving either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status
   or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore, when a client sends this
   header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it
   has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client &SHOULD-NOT;  wait
   for an indefinite period before sending the request body.
</t>

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:

        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server &MUST-NOT; wait for the request body before sending
        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it &MAY; close the transport connection or it &MAY; continue
        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It &MUST-NOT;
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server &SHOULD-NOT;  send a 100 (Continue) response if
        the request message does not include an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, and &MUST-NOT; send a
        100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0
        (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for
        compatibility with <xref target="RFC2068"/>, a server &MAY; send a 100 (Continue)
        status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
        not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-continue"
        expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is
        to minimize any client processing delays associated with an
        undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status, applies only to
        HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-version
        value.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server &MAY; omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has
        already received some or all of the request body for the
        corresponding request.
    </t>
    <t> An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response &MUST;
    ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is
        received and processed, unless it terminates the transport
        connection prematurely.
    </t>
    <t> If an origin server receives a request that does not include an
        Expect request-header field with the "100-continue" expectation,
        the request includes a request body, and the server responds
        with a final status code before reading the entire request body
        from the transport connection, then the server &SHOULD-NOT;  close
        the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
        or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
        might not reliably receive the response message. However, this
        requirement is not be construed as preventing a server from
        defending itself against denial-of-service attacks, or from
        badly broken client implementations.

<section title="Header Field Definitions" anchor="header.fields">
<t>
   This section defines the syntax and semantics of HTTP/1.1 header fields
   related to message framing and transport protocols.
</t>
<t>
   For entity-header fields, both sender and recipient refer to either the
   client or the server, depending on who sends and who receives the entity.
</t>

  <x:anchor-alias value="Connection"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="connection-token"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Connection-v"/>
<t>
   The general-header field "Connection" allows the sender to specify
   options that are desired for that particular connection and &MUST-NOT;
   be communicated by proxies over further connections.
</t>
<t>
   The Connection header's value has the following grammar:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Connection"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Connection-v"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="connection-token"/>

  <x:ref>connection-token</x:ref> = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 proxies &MUST; parse the Connection header field before a
   message is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field,
   remove any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the
   connection-token. Connection options are signaled by the presence of
   a connection-token in the Connection header field, not by any
   corresponding additional header field(s), since the additional header
   field may not be sent if there are no parameters associated with that
   connection option.
</t>
<t>
   Message headers listed in the Connection header &MUST-NOT; include
   end-to-end headers, such as Cache-Control.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to
   signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the
   response. For example,
</t>

<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 client that does not support persistent connections &MUST;

<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 server that does not support persistent connections &MUST;
   include the "close" connection option in every response message that
   does not have a 1xx (informational) status code.
</t>
<t>
   A system receiving an HTTP/1.0 (or lower-version) message that
   includes a Connection header &MUST;, for each connection-token in this
   field, remove and ignore any header field(s) from the message with
   the same name as the connection-token. This protects against mistaken
   forwarding of such header fields by pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies. See <xref target="compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections"/>.

<t>
   A "host" without any trailing port information implies the default
   port for the service requested (e.g., "80" for an HTTP URL). For
   example, a request on the origin server for
   &lt;http://www.example.org/pub/WWW/&gt; would properly include:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.org
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A client &MUST; include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages. If the requested URI does not include an Internet host
   name for the service being requested, then the Host header field &MUST;
   be given with an empty value. An HTTP/1.1 proxy &MUST; ensure that any
   request message it forwards does contain an appropriate Host header
   field that identifies the service being requested by the proxy. All
   Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers &MUST; respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
   status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header
   field.

   The request-header field "TE" indicates what extension transfer-codings
   it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding. Its
   value may consist of the keyword "trailers" and/or a comma-separated
   list of extension transfer-coding names with optional accept
   parameters (as described in <xref target="transfer.codings"/>).

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding, as
   defined in <xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding"/>. This keyword is reserved for use with
   transfer-coding values even though it does not itself represent a
   transfer-coding.
</t>
<t>
   Examples of its use are:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  TE: deflate
  TE:
  TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the keyword &MUST; be supplied within a Connection header
   field (<xref target="header.connection"/>) whenever TE is present in an HTTP/1.1 message.
</t>
<t>
   A server tests whether a transfer-coding is acceptable, according to
   a TE field, using these rules:
  <list style="numbers">
    <x:lt>
      <t>The "chunked" transfer-coding is always acceptable. If the
         keyword "trailers" is listed, the client indicates that it is
         willing to accept trailer fields in the chunked response on
         behalf of itself and any downstream clients. The implication is
         that, if given, the client is stating that either all
         downstream clients are willing to accept trailer fields in the
         forwarded response, or that it will attempt to buffer the
         response on behalf of downstream recipients.
      </t><t>
         <x:h>Note:</x:h> HTTP/1.1 does not define any means to limit the size of a
         chunked response such that a client can be assured of buffering
         the entire response.</t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
      <t>If the transfer-coding being tested is one of the transfer-codings
         listed in the TE field, then it is acceptable unless it
         is accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in <xref target="quality.values"/>, a
         qvalue of 0 means "not acceptable.")</t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
      <t>If multiple transfer-codings are acceptable, then the
         acceptable transfer-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is
         preferred.  The "chunked" transfer-coding always has a qvalue
         of 1.</t>
    </x:lt>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, the only
   transfer-coding is "chunked". A message with no transfer-coding is
   always acceptable.

<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 message &SHOULD; include a Trailer header field in a
   message using chunked transfer-coding with a non-empty trailer. Doing
   so allows the recipient to know which header fields to expect in the
   trailer.
</t>

   If no Trailer header field is present, the trailer &SHOULD-NOT;  include
   any header fields. See <xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding"/> for restrictions on the use of

<t>
   Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field &MUST-NOT;

   The general-header "Transfer-Encoding" field indicates what (if any)
   type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order
   to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This
   differs from the content-coding in that the transfer-coding is a
   property of the message, not of the entity.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Upgrade"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Upgrade-v"/>
<t>
   The general-header "Upgrade" allows the client to specify what
   additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use
   if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. The server
   &MUST; use the Upgrade header field within a 101 (Switching Protocols)
   response to indicate which protocol(s) are being switched.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Upgrade"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Upgrade-v"/>
  <x:ref>Upgrade</x:ref>   = "Upgrade" ":" <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> <x:ref>Upgrade-v</x:ref>
  <x:ref>Upgrade-v</x:ref> = 1#<x:ref>product</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
   for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It
   does so by allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another
   protocol, such as a later version of HTTP with a higher major version
   number, even though the current request has been made using HTTP/1.1.
   This eases the difficult transition between incompatible protocols by
   allowing the client to initiate a request in the more commonly
   supported protocol while indicating to the server that it would like
   to use a "better" protocol if available (where "better" is determined
   by the server, possibly according to the nature of the method and/or
   resource being requested).
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field only applies to switching application-layer
   protocols upon the existing transport-layer connection. Upgrade
   cannot be used to insist on a protocol change; its acceptance and use
   by the server is optional. The capabilities and nature of the
   application-layer communication after the protocol change is entirely
   dependent upon the new protocol chosen, although the first action
   after changing the protocol &MUST; be a response to the initial HTTP
   request containing the Upgrade header field.
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the upgrade keyword &MUST; be supplied within a Connection
   header field (<xref target="header.connection"/>) whenever Upgrade is present in an
   HTTP/1.1 message.
</t>
<t>
   The Upgrade header field cannot be used to indicate a switch to a
   protocol on a different connection. For that purpose, it is more
   appropriate to use a 301, 302, 303, or 305 redirection response.
</t>
<t>
   This specification only defines the protocol name "HTTP" for use by
   the family of Hypertext Transfer Protocols, as defined by the HTTP
   version rules of <xref target="http.version"/> and future updates to this
   specification. Any token can be used as a protocol name; however, it
   will only be useful if both the client and server associate the name
   with the same protocol.

<section title="Via" anchor="header.via">

<t>
   The general-header field "Via" &MUST; be used by gateways and proxies to
   indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user
   agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and
   the client on responses. It is analogous to the "Received" field defined in
   <xref target="RFC5322" x:fmt="of" x:sec="3.6.7"/> and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,
   avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of
   all senders along the request/response chain.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Via"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Via-v"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="received-protocol"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="protocol-name"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="protocol-version"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="received-by"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="pseudonym"/>

                          [ <x:ref>RWS</x:ref> <x:ref>comment</x:ref> ] )

  <x:ref>pseudonym</x:ref>         = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message
   received by the server or client along each segment of the
   request/response chain. The received-protocol version is appended to
   the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information
   about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains
   visible to all recipients.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be "HTTP". The
   received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of a
   recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,
   it &MAY; be replaced by a pseudonym. If the port is not given, it &MAY;
   be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple Via field values represents each proxy or gateway that has
   forwarded the message. Each recipient &MUST; append its information
   such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of
   forwarding applications.
</t>
<t>
   Comments &MAY; be used in the Via header field to identify the software
   of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and
   Server header fields. However, all comments in the Via field are
   optional and &MAY; be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the
   message.
</t>
<t>
   For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user
   agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to
   forward the request to a public proxy at p.example.net, which completes
   the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.example.com.
   The request received by www.example.com would then have the following
   Via header field:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 p.example.net (Apache/1.1)
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Proxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall
   &SHOULD-NOT;, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts within
   the firewall region. This information &SHOULD; only be propagated if
   explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host
   behind the firewall &SHOULD; be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym
   for that host.
</t>
<t>
   For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding
   internal structures, a proxy &MAY; combine an ordered subsequence of
   Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into
   a single such entry. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy
</artwork></figure>
<t>
        could be collapsed to
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 mertz, 1.0 lucy
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Applications &SHOULD-NOT;  combine multiple entries unless they are all
   under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been
   replaced by pseudonyms. Applications &MUST-NOT; combine entries which
   have different received-protocol values.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<t>
   This section is meant to inform application developers, information
   providers, and users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1 as
   described by this document. The discussion does not include
   definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make
   some suggestions for reducing security risks.
</t>

<section title="Personal Information" anchor="personal.information">
<t>
   HTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information
   (e.g. the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption
   keys, etc.), and &SHOULD; be very careful to prevent unintentional
   leakage of this information.
   We very strongly recommend that a convenient interface be provided
   for the user to control dissemination of such information, and that
   designers and implementors be particularly careful in this area.
   History shows that errors in this area often create serious security
   and/or privacy problems and generate highly adverse publicity for the
   implementor's company.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Abuse of Server Log Information" anchor="abuse.of.server.log.information">
<t>
   A server is in the position to save personal data about a user's
   requests which might identify their reading patterns or subjects of
   interest. This information is clearly confidential in nature and its
   handling can be constrained by law in certain countries. People using
   HTTP to provide data are responsible for ensuring that
   such material is not distributed without the permission of any
   individuals that are identifiable by the published results.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Attacks Based On File and Path Names" anchor="attack.pathname">
<t>
   Implementations of HTTP origin servers &SHOULD; be careful to restrict
   the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were
   intended by the server administrators. If an HTTP server translates
   HTTP URIs directly into file system calls, the server &MUST; take
   special care not to serve files that were not intended to be
   delivered to HTTP clients. For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and
   other operating systems use ".." as a path component to indicate a
   directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP
   server &MUST; disallow any such construct in the request-target if it
   would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to
   be accessible via the HTTP server. Similarly, files intended for
   reference only internally to the server (such as access control
   files, configuration files, and script code) &MUST; be protected from
   inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive
   information. Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server
   implementations have turned into security risks.
</t>
</section>

<section title="DNS Spoofing" anchor="dns.spoofing">
<t>
   Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are
   thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate
   mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. Clients need to be
   cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name
   association.
</t>
<t>
   In particular, HTTP clients &SHOULD; rely on their name resolver for
   confirmation of an IP number/DNS name association, rather than
   caching the result of previous host name lookups. Many platforms
   already can cache host name lookups locally when appropriate, and
   they &SHOULD; be configured to do so. It is proper for these lookups to
   be cached, however, only when the TTL (Time To Live) information
   reported by the name server makes it likely that the cached
   information will remain useful.
</t>
<t>
   If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to
   achieve a performance improvement, they &MUST; observe the TTL
   information reported by DNS.
</t>
<t>
   If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when
   a previously-accessed server's IP address changes. As network
   renumbering is expected to become increasingly common <xref target="RFC1900"/>, the
   possibility of this form of attack will grow. Observing this
   requirement thus reduces this potential security vulnerability.
</t>
<t>
   This requirement also improves the load-balancing behavior of clients
   for replicated servers using the same DNS name and reduces the
   likelihood of a user's experiencing failure in accessing sites which
   use that strategy.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Proxies and Caching" anchor="attack.proxies">
<t>
   By their very nature, HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and
   represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Compromise of
   the systems on which the proxies run can result in serious security
   and privacy problems. Proxies have access to security-related
   information, personal information about individual users and
   organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and
   content providers. A compromised proxy, or a proxy implemented or
   configured without regard to security and privacy considerations,
   might be used in the commission of a wide range of potential attacks.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run as
   they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive
   information. In particular, log information gathered at proxies often
   contains highly sensitive personal information, and/or information
   about organizations. Log information should be carefully guarded, and
   appropriate guidelines for use developed and followed. (<xref target="abuse.of.server.log.information"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Proxy implementors should consider the privacy and security
   implications of their design and coding decisions, and of the
   configuration options they provide to proxy operators (especially the
   default configuration).
</t>
<t>
   Users of a proxy need to be aware that they are no trustworthier than
   the people who run the proxy; HTTP itself cannot solve this problem.
</t>
<t>
   The judicious use of cryptography, when appropriate, may suffice to
   protect against a broad range of security and privacy attacks. Such
   cryptography is beyond the scope of the HTTP/1.1 specification.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Denial of Service Attacks on Proxies" anchor="attack.DoS">
<t>
   They exist. They are hard to defend against. Research continues.
   Beware.

<section title="Acknowledgments" anchor="ack">
<t>
   HTTP has evolved considerably over the years. It has
   benefited from a large and active developer community--the many
   people who have participated on the www-talk mailing list--and it is
   that community which has been most responsible for the success of
   HTTP and of the World-Wide Web in general. Marc Andreessen, Robert
   Cailliau, Daniel W. Connolly, Bob Denny, John Franks, Jean-Francois
   Groff, Phillip M. Hallam-Baker, Hakon W. Lie, Ari Luotonen, Rob
   McCool, Lou Montulli, Dave Raggett, Tony Sanders, and Marc
   VanHeyningen deserve special recognition for their efforts in
   defining early aspects of the protocol.
</t>
<t>
   This document has benefited greatly from the comments of all those
   participating in the HTTP-WG. In addition to those already mentioned,
   the following individuals have contributed to this specification:
</t>
<t>
   Gary Adams, Harald Tveit Alvestrand, Keith Ball, Brian Behlendorf,
   Paul Burchard, Maurizio Codogno, Mike Cowlishaw, Roman Czyborra,
   Michael A. Dolan, Daniel DuBois, David J. Fiander, Alan Freier, Marc Hedlund, Greg Herlihy,
   Koen Holtman, Alex Hopmann, Bob Jernigan, Shel Kaphan, Rohit Khare,
   John Klensin, Martijn Koster, Alexei Kosut, David M. Kristol,

</t>
<t>
   Thanks to the "cave men" of Palo Alto. You know who you are.
</t>
<t>
   Jim Gettys (the editor of <xref target="RFC2616"/>) wishes particularly
   to thank Roy Fielding, the editor of <xref target="RFC2068"/>, along
   with John Klensin, Jeff Mogul, Paul Leach, Dave Kristol, Koen
   Holtman, John Franks, Josh Cohen, Alex Hopmann, Scott Lawrence, and
   Larry Masinter for their help. And thanks go particularly to Jeff
   Mogul and Scott Lawrence for performing the "MUST/MAY/SHOULD" audit.
</t>
<t>
   The Apache Group, Anselm Baird-Smith, author of Jigsaw, and Henrik
   Frystyk implemented RFC 2068 early, and we wish to thank them for the
   discovery of many of the problems that this document attempts to
   rectify.
</t>
<t>
   This specification makes heavy use of the augmented BNF and generic
   constructs defined by David H. Crocker for <xref target="RFC5234"/>. Similarly, it
   reuses many of the definitions provided by Nathaniel Borenstein and
   Ned Freed for MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/>. We hope that their inclusion in this
   specification will help reduce past confusion over the relationship
   between HTTP and Internet mail message formats.

<section title="Tolerant Applications" anchor="tolerant.applications">
<t>
   Although this document specifies the requirements for the generation
   of HTTP/1.1 messages, not all applications will be correct in their
   implementation. We therefore recommend that operational applications
   be tolerant of deviations whenever those deviations can be
   interpreted unambiguously.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD; be tolerant in parsing the Status-Line and servers
   tolerant when parsing the Request-Line. In particular, they &SHOULD;
   accept any amount of WSP characters between fields, even though
   only a single SP is required.
</t>
<t>
   The line terminator for message-header fields is the sequence CRLF.
   However, we recommend that applications, when parsing such headers,
   recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore the leading CR.
</t>
<t>
   The character set of an entity-body &SHOULD; be labeled as the lowest
   common denominator of the character codes used within that body, with
   the exception that not labeling the entity is preferred over labeling
   the entity with the labels US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1. See &payload;.
</t>
<t>
   Additional rules for requirements on parsing and encoding of dates
   and other potential problems with date encodings include:
</t>
<t>
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>HTTP/1.1 clients and caches &SHOULD; assume that an RFC-850 date
        which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact
        in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).</t>

     <t>An HTTP/1.1 implementation &MAY; internally represent a parsed
        Expires date as earlier than the proper value, but &MUST-NOT;
        internally represent a parsed Expires date as later than the
        proper value.</t>

     <t>All expiration-related calculations &MUST; be done in GMT. The
        local time zone &MUST-NOT; influence the calculation or comparison
        of an age or expiration time.</t>

     <t>If an HTTP header incorrectly carries a date value with a time
        zone other than GMT, it &MUST; be converted into GMT using the
        most conservative possible conversion.</t>
  </list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Compatibility with Previous Versions" anchor="compatibility">
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative
   since 1990. The first version of HTTP, later referred to as HTTP/0.9,
   was a simple protocol for hypertext data transfer across the Internet
   with only a single method and no metadata.
   HTTP/1.0, as defined by <xref target="RFC1945"/>, added a range of request
   methods and MIME-like messaging that could include metadata about the data
   transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However,
   HTTP/1.0 did not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of
   hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or
   name-based virtual hosts. The proliferation of incompletely-implemented
   applications calling themselves "HTTP/1.0" further necessitated a
   protocol version change in order for two communicating applications
   to determine each other's true capabilities.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 remains compatible with HTTP/1.0 by including more stringent
   requirements that enable reliable implementations, adding only
   those new features that will either be safely ignored by an HTTP/1.0
   recipient or only sent when communicating with a party advertising
   compliance with HTTP/1.1.
</t>
<t>
   It is beyond the scope of a protocol specification to mandate
   compliance with previous versions. HTTP/1.1 was deliberately
   designed, however, to make supporting previous versions easy. It is
   worth noting that, at the time of composing this specification
   (1996), we would expect commercial HTTP/1.1 servers to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9, 1.0, and
        1.1 requests;</t>

     <t>understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or
        1.1;</t>

     <t>respond appropriately with a message in the same major version
        used by the client.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   And we would expect HTTP/1.1 clients to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>recognize the format of the Status-Line for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1
        responses;</t>

     <t>understand any valid response in the format of HTTP/0.9, 1.0, or
        1.1.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   For most implementations of HTTP/1.0, each connection is established
   by the client prior to the request and closed by the server after
   sending the response. Some implementations implement the Keep-Alive
   version of persistent connections described in <xref x:sec="19.7.1" x:fmt="of" target="RFC2068"/>.
</t>

<section title="Changes from HTTP/1.0" anchor="changes.from.1.0">
<t>
   This section summarizes major differences between versions HTTP/1.0
   and HTTP/1.1.
</t>

<section title="Changes to Simplify Multi-homed Web Servers and Conserve IP Addresses" anchor="changes.to.simplify.multi-homed.web.servers.and.conserve.ip.addresses">
<t>
   The requirements that clients and servers support the Host request-header,
   report an error if the Host request-header (<xref target="header.host"/>) is
   missing from an HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs (<xref target="request-target"/>)
   are among the most important changes defined by this
   specification.
</t>
<t>
   Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP
   addresses and servers; there was no other established mechanism for
   distinguishing the intended server of a request than the IP address
   to which that request was directed. The changes outlined above will
   allow the Internet, once older HTTP clients are no longer common, to
   support multiple Web sites from a single IP address, greatly
   simplifying large operational Web servers, where allocation of many
   IP addresses to a single host has created serious problems. The
   Internet will also be able to recover the IP addresses that have been
   allocated for the sole purpose of allowing special-purpose domain
   names to be used in root-level HTTP URLs. Given the rate of growth of
   the Web, and the number of servers already deployed, it is extremely
   important that all implementations of HTTP (including updates to
   existing HTTP/1.0 applications) correctly implement these
   requirements:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>Both clients and servers &MUST; support the Host request-header.</t>

     <t>A client that sends an HTTP/1.1 request &MUST; send a Host header.</t>

     <t>Servers &MUST; report a 400 (Bad Request) error if an HTTP/1.1
        request does not include a Host request-header.</t>

     <t>Servers &MUST; accept absolute URIs.</t>
  </list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Compatibility with HTTP/1.0 Persistent Connections" anchor="compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections">
<t>
   Some clients and servers might wish to be compatible with some
   previous implementations of persistent connections in HTTP/1.0
   clients and servers. Persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 are
   explicitly negotiated as they are not the default behavior. HTTP/1.0
   experimental implementations of persistent connections are faulty,
   and the new facilities in HTTP/1.1 are designed to rectify these
   problems. The problem was that some existing 1.0 clients may be
   sending Keep-Alive to a proxy server that doesn't understand
   Connection, which would then erroneously forward it to the next
   inbound server, which would establish the Keep-Alive connection and
   result in a hung HTTP/1.0 proxy waiting for the close on the
   response. The result is that HTTP/1.0 clients must be prevented from
   using Keep-Alive when talking to proxies.
</t>
<t>
   However, talking to proxies is the most important use of persistent
   connections, so that prohibition is clearly unacceptable. Therefore,
   we need some other mechanism for indicating a persistent connection
   is desired, which is safe to use even when talking to an old proxy
   that ignores Connection. Persistent connections are the default for
   HTTP/1.1 messages; we introduce a new keyword (Connection: close) for
   declaring non-persistence. See <xref target="header.connection"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The original HTTP/1.0 form of persistent connections (the Connection:
   Keep-Alive and Keep-Alive header) is documented in <xref x:sec="19.7.1" x:fmt="of" target="RFC2068"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes from RFC 2068" anchor="changes.from.rfc.2068">
<t>
   This specification has been carefully audited to correct and
   disambiguate key word usage; RFC 2068 had many problems in respect to
   the conventions laid out in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Transfer-coding and message lengths all interact in ways that
   required fixing exactly when chunked encoding is used (to allow for
   transfer encoding that may not be self delimiting); it was important
   to straighten out exactly how message lengths are computed. (Sections
   <xref target="transfer.codings" format="counter"/>, <xref target="message.length" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="header.content-length" format="counter"/>,
   see also <xref target="Part3"/>, <xref target="Part5"/> and <xref target="Part6"/>)
</t>
<t>
   The use and interpretation of HTTP version numbers has been clarified
   by <xref target="RFC2145"/>. Require proxies to upgrade requests to highest protocol
   version they support to deal with problems discovered in HTTP/1.0
   implementations (<xref target="http.version"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Quality Values of zero should indicate that "I don't want something"
   to allow clients to refuse a representation. (<xref target="quality.values"/>)

   Transfer-coding had significant problems, particularly with
   interactions with chunked encoding. The solution is that transfer-codings
   become as full fledged as content-codings. This involves
   adding an IANA registry for transfer-codings (separate from content
   codings), a new header field (TE) and enabling trailer headers in the
   future. Transfer encoding is a major performance benefit, so it was
   worth fixing <xref target="Nie1997"/>. TE also solves another, obscure, downward
   interoperability problem that could have occurred due to interactions
   between authentication trailers, chunked encoding and HTTP/1.0
   clients.(Section <xref target="transfer.codings" format="counter"/>, <xref target="chunked.transfer.encoding" format="counter"/>,
   and <xref target="header.te" format="counter"/>)

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
<t>
   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   played by participants in, and objects of, the HTTP communication.
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="cache"/>
  <x:dfn>cache</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A program's local store of response messages and the subsystem
      that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A
      cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response
      time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent
      requests. Any client or server may include a cache, though a cache
      cannot be used by a server that is acting as a tunnel.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="cacheable"/>
  <x:dfn>cacheable</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A response is cacheable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of
      the response message for use in answering subsequent requests. The
      rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are
      defined in &caching;. Even if a resource is cacheable, there may
      be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached
      copy for a particular request.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="client"/>
  <x:dfn>client</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending
      requests.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="connection"/>
  <x:dfn>connection</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A transport layer virtual circuit established between two programs
      for the purpose of communication.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="content negotiation"/>
  <x:dfn>content negotiation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when
      servicing a request, as described in &content.negotiation;. The
      representation of entities in any response can be negotiated
      (including error responses).
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="entity"/>
  <x:dfn>entity</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The information transferred as the payload of a request or
      response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of
      entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as
      described in &entity;.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="gateway"/>
  <x:dfn>gateway</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server.
      Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it were the
      origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client
      may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway.
    </t>
  </list>

<t>
  <iref item="inbound"/>
  <iref item="outbound"/>
  <x:dfn>inbound</x:dfn>/<x:dfn>outbound</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      Inbound and outbound refer to the request and response paths for
      messages: "inbound" means "traveling toward the origin server",
      and "outbound" means "traveling toward the user agent"
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="message"/>
  <x:dfn>message</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured
      sequence of octets matching the syntax defined in <xref target="http.message"/> and
      transmitted via the connection.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="origin server"/>
  <x:dfn>origin server</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The server on which a given resource resides or is to be created.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="proxy"/>
  <x:dfn>proxy</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client
      for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.
      Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with
      possible translation, to other servers. A proxy &MUST; implement
      both the client and server requirements of this specification. A
      "transparent proxy" is a proxy that does not modify the request or
      response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and
      identification. A "non-transparent proxy" is a proxy that modifies
      the request or response in order to provide some added service to
      the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type
      transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except
      where either transparent or non-transparent behavior is explicitly
      stated, the HTTP proxy requirements apply to both types of
      proxies.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="request"/>
  <x:dfn>request</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An HTTP request message, as defined in <xref target="request"/>.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="resource"/>
  <x:dfn>resource</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI,
      as defined in <xref target="uri"/>. Resources may be available in multiple
      representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, and
      resolutions) or vary in other ways.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="response"/>
  <x:dfn>response</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An HTTP response message, as defined in <xref target="response"/>.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="representation"/>
  <x:dfn>representation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An entity included with a response that is subject to content
      negotiation, as described in &content.negotiation;. There may exist multiple
      representations associated with a particular response status.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="server"/>
  <x:dfn>server</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An application program that accepts connections in order to
      service requests by sending back responses. Any given program may
      be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these
      terms refers only to the role being performed by the program for a
      particular connection, rather than to the program's capabilities
      in general. Likewise, any server may act as an origin server,
      proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the nature
      of each request.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="tunnel"/>
  <x:dfn>tunnel</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between
      two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party
      to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been
      initiated by an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to exist when both
      ends of the relayed connections are closed.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="upstream"/>
  <iref item="downstream"/>
  <x:dfn>upstream</x:dfn>/<x:dfn>downstream</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      Upstream and downstream describe the flow of a message: all
      messages flow from upstream to downstream.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="user agent"/>
  <x:dfn>user agent</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers,
      editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="variant"/>
  <x:dfn>variant</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      A resource may have one, or more than one, representation(s)
      associated with it at any given instant. Each of these
      representations is termed a `variant'.  Use of the term `variant'
      does not necessarily imply that the resource is subject to content
      negotiation.
