Appendix A., paragraph 3:
OLD:

    New status codes can now define that caches are allowed to use
    heuristic freshness with them.  Caches are now allowed to calculate
    heuristic freshness for URIs with query components.  (Section 4.2.2)
 
    The algorithm for calculating age is now less conservative.  Caches
    are now required to handle dates with time zones as if they're
    invalid, because it's not possible to accurately guess.
    (Section 4.2.3)
