Appendix A., paragraph 2:
OLD:

    Weak entity-tags are now allowed in all requests except range
    requests.  (Sections 2.1 and 3.2)
    The ETag header field ABNF has been changed to not use quoted-string,
    thus avoiding escaping issues.  (Section 2.3)
 
    ETag is defined to provide an entity tag for the selected
    representation, thereby clarifying what it applies to in various
    situations (such as a PUT response).  (Section 2.3)
