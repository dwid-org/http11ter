   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for
   distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document
   defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields
   for indicating state changes, request header fields for making
   preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a
   conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
   Conditional requests are HTTP requests <xref target="Part2"/> that include
   one or more header fields indicating a precondition to be tested before
   applying the method semantics to the target resource.
   Each precondition is based on metadata that is expected to change if the
   selected representation of the target resource is changed.
   This document defines the HTTP/1.1 conditional request mechanisms in terms
   of the architecture, syntax notation, and conformance criteria defined in
   <xref target="Part1"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Conditional GET requests are the most efficient mechanism for HTTP
   cache updates &caching;.  Conditionals can also be
   applied to state-changing methods, such as PUT and DELETE, to prevent
   the "lost update" problem: one client accidentally overwriting
   the work of another client that has been acting in parallel.
</t>
<t>
   Conditional request preconditions are based on the state of the target
   resource as a whole (its current value set) or the state as observed
   in a previously obtained representation (one value in that set).
   A resource might have multiple current representations, each with its
   own observable state.  The conditional request mechanisms assume that
   the mapping of requests to corresponding representations will be
   consistent over time if the server intends to take advantage of
   conditionals.  Regardless, if the mapping is inconsistent and
   the server is unable to select the appropriate representation, then
   no harm will result when the precondition evaluates to false.
</t>
<t><iref primary="true" item="selected representation"/>
   We use the term "<x:dfn>selected representation</x:dfn>" to refer to
   the current representation of the target resource that would have been
   selected in a successful response if the same request had used the method
   GET and had excluded all of the conditional request header fields.
   The conditional request preconditions are evaluated by comparing the
   values provided in the request header fields to the current metadata
   for the selected representation.
</t>

<section title="Conformance and Error Handling" anchor="intro.conformance.and.error.handling">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   This specification targets conformance criteria according to the role of
   a participant in HTTP communication.  Hence, HTTP requirements are placed
   on senders, recipients, clients, servers, user agents, intermediaries,
   origin servers, proxies, gateways, or caches, depending on what behavior
   is being constrained by the requirement. See &architecture; for definitions
   of these terms.
</t>
<t>
   The verb "generate" is used instead of "send" where a requirement
   differentiates between creating a protocol element and merely forwarding a
   received element downstream.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is considered conformant if it complies with all of the
   requirements associated with the roles it partakes in HTTP. Note that
   SHOULD-level requirements are relevant here, unless one of the documented
   exceptions is applicable.
</t>
<t>
   This document also uses ABNF to define valid protocol elements
   (<xref target="notation"/>).
   In addition to the prose requirements placed upon them, senders &MUST-NOT;
   generate protocol elements that do not match the grammar defined by the
   ABNF rules for those protocol elements that are applicable to the sender's
   role. If a received protocol element is processed, the recipient &MUST; be
   able to parse any value that would match the ABNF rules for that protocol
   element, excluding only those rules not applicable to the recipient's role.
</t>
<t>
   Unless noted otherwise, a recipient &MAY; attempt to recover a usable
   protocol element from an invalid construct.  HTTP does not define
   specific error handling mechanisms except when they have a direct impact
   on security, since different applications of the protocol require
   different error handling strategies.  For example, a Web browser might
   wish to transparently recover from a response where the
   <x:ref>Location</x:ref> header field doesn't parse according to the ABNF,
   whereas a systems control client might consider any form of error recovery
   to be dangerous.

<section title="Validators" anchor="validators">
   <iref primary="true" item="metadata"/>
   <iref primary="true" item="validator"/>
<t>
   This specification defines two forms of metadata that are commonly used
   to observe resource state and test for preconditions: modification dates
   (<xref target="header.last-modified"/>) and opaque entity tags
   (<xref target="header.etag"/>).  Additional metadata that reflects resource state
   has been defined by various extensions of HTTP, such as WebDAV
   <xref target="RFC4918"/>, that are beyond the scope of this specification.
   A resource metadata value is referred to as a "<x:dfn>validator</x:dfn>"
   when it is used within a precondition.
</t>

<section title="Weak versus Strong" anchor="weak.and.strong.validators">
   <iref primary="true" item="validator" subitem="weak"/>
   <iref primary="true" item="validator" subitem="strong"/>
<t>
   Validators come in two flavors: strong or weak.  Weak validators are easy
   to generate but are far less useful for comparisons.  Strong validators
   are ideal for comparisons but can be very difficult (and occasionally
   impossible) to generate efficiently.  Rather than impose that all forms
   of resource adhere to the same strength of validator, HTTP exposes the
   type of validator in use and imposes restrictions on when weak validators
   can be used as preconditions.
</t>
<t>
   A "strong validator" is a representation metadata value that &MUST; be
   changed to a new, previously unused or guaranteed unique, value whenever
   a change occurs to the representation data such that a change would be
   observable in the payload body of a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response to GET.
</t>
<t>   
   A strong validator &MAY; be changed for other reasons, such as when a semantically
   significant part of the representation metadata is changed (e.g.,
   <x:ref>Content-Type</x:ref>), but it is in the best interests of the origin
   server to only change the value when it is necessary to invalidate the
   stored responses held by remote caches and authoring tools.  A strong
   validator &MUST; be unique across all representations of a given resource,
   such that no two representations of that resource share the same validator
   unless their payload body would be identical.
</t>
<t>
   Cache entries might persist for arbitrarily long periods, regardless
   of expiration times.  Thus, a cache might attempt to validate an
   entry using a validator that it obtained in the distant past.
   A strong validator &MUST; be unique across all versions of all
   representations associated with a particular resource over time.
   However, there is no implication of uniqueness across representations
   of different resources (i.e., the same strong validator might be
   in use for representations of multiple resources at the same time
   and does not imply that those representations are equivalent).
</t>
<t>
   There are a variety of strong validators used in practice.  The best are
   based on strict revision control, wherein each change to a representation
   always results in a unique node name and revision identifier being assigned
   before the representation is made accessible to GET.  A collision-resistant hash
   function applied to the representation data is also sufficient if the data
   is available prior to the response header fields being sent and the digest
   does not need to be recalculated every time a validation request is
   received.  However, if a resource has distinct representations that differ
   only in their metadata, such as might occur with content negotiation over
   media types that happen to share the same data format, then the origin
   server &SHOULD; incorporate additional information in the validator to
   distinguish those representations and avoid confusing cache behavior.
</t>
<t>
   In contrast, a "weak validator" is a representation metadata value that
   might not be changed for every change to the representation data.  This
   weakness might be due to limitations in how the value is calculated, such
   as clock resolution or an inability to ensure uniqueness for all possible
   representations of the resource, or due to a desire by the resource owner
   to group representations by some self-determined set of equivalency
   rather than unique sequences of data.  An origin server &SHOULD; change a
   weak entity-tag whenever it considers prior representations to be
   unacceptable as a substitute for the current representation. In other words,
   a weak entity-tag ought to change whenever the origin server wants caches to
   invalidate old responses.
</t>
<t>
   For example, the representation of a weather report that changes in
   content every second, based on dynamic measurements, might be grouped
   into sets of equivalent representations (from the origin server's
   perspective) with the same weak validator in order to allow cached
   representations to be valid for a reasonable period of time (perhaps
   adjusted dynamically based on server load or weather quality).
   Likewise, a representation's modification time, if defined with only
   one-second resolution, might be a weak validator if it is possible
   for the representation to be modified twice during a single second and
   retrieved between those modifications.
</t>
<t>
   A "use" of a validator occurs when either a client generates a request
   and includes the validator in a precondition or when a server
   compares two validators.
   Weak validators are only usable in contexts that do not depend on exact
   equality of a representation's payload body.
   Strong validators are usable and preferred for all conditional requests,
   including cache validation, partial content ranges, and "lost update"
   avoidance.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Last-Modified"/>
<t>
   The "Last-Modified" header field indicates the date and time at
   which the origin server believes the selected representation was
   last modified.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Last-Modified"/>

<t>
   An example of its use is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
</artwork></figure>

<section title="Generation" anchor="lastmod.generation">
<t>
   Origin servers &SHOULD; send Last-Modified for any selected
   representation for which a last modification date can be reasonably
   and consistently determined, since its use in conditional requests
   and evaluating cache freshness (&caching;) results in a substantial
   reduction of HTTP traffic on the Internet and can be a significant
   factor in improving service scalability and reliability.
</t>
<t>
   A representation is typically the sum of many parts behind the
   resource interface.  The last-modified time would usually be
   the most recent time that any of those parts were changed.
   How that value is determined for any given resource is an
   implementation detail beyond the scope of this specification.
   What matters to HTTP is how recipients of the Last-Modified
   header field can use its value to make conditional requests
   and test the validity of locally cached responses.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server &SHOULD; obtain the Last-Modified value of the
   representation as close as possible to the time that it generates the
   <x:ref>Date</x:ref> field value for its response. This allows a recipient to
   make an accurate assessment of the representation's modification time,
   especially if the representation changes near the time that the
   response is generated.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server with a clock &MUST-NOT; send a Last-Modified date
   that is later than the server's time of message origination (<x:ref>Date</x:ref>).
   If the last modification time is derived from implementation-specific
   metadata that evaluates to some time in the future, according to the
   origin server's clock, then the origin server &MUST; replace that
   value with the message origination date. This prevents a future
   modification date from having an adverse impact on cache validation.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server without a clock &MUST-NOT; assign Last-Modified
   values to a response unless these values were associated
   with the resource by some other system or user with a reliable clock.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Comparison" anchor="lastmod.comparison">
<t>
   A Last-Modified time, when used as a validator in a request, is
   implicitly weak unless it is possible to deduce that it is strong,
   using the following rules:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is being compared by an origin server to the
        actual current validator for the representation and,</t>
     <t>That origin server reliably knows that the associated representation did
        not change twice during the second covered by the presented
        validator.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   or
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is about to be used by a client in an <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref>,
        <x:ref>If-Unmodified-Since</x:ref> header field, because the client has
        a cache entry, or <x:ref>If-Range</x:ref> for the associated
        representation, and</t>
     <t>That cache entry includes a <x:ref>Date</x:ref> value, which gives the
        time when the origin server sent the original response, and</t>
     <t>The presented Last-Modified time is at least 60 seconds before
        the Date value.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   or
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The validator is being compared by an intermediate cache to the
        validator stored in its cache entry for the representation, and</t>
     <t>That cache entry includes a <x:ref>Date</x:ref> value, which gives the
        time when the origin server sent the original response, and</t>
     <t>The presented Last-Modified time is at least 60 seconds before
        the Date value.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This method relies on the fact that if two different responses were
   sent by the origin server during the same second, but both had the
   same Last-Modified time, then at least one of those responses would
   have a <x:ref>Date</x:ref> value equal to its Last-Modified time. The
   arbitrary 60-second limit guards against the possibility that the Date and
   Last-Modified values are generated from different clocks, or at somewhat
   different times during the preparation of the response. An
   implementation &MAY; use a value larger than 60 seconds, if it is
   believed that 60 seconds is too short.

   An entity-tag is an opaque validator for differentiating between

   those multiple representations are due to resource state changes over
   time, content negotiation resulting in multiple representations being
   valid at the same time, or both. An entity-tag consists of an opaque

<x:note>
  <t>
    &Note; Previously, opaque-tag was defined to be a quoted-string
    (<xref target="RFC2616" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.11"/>), thus some recipients
    might perform backslash unescaping. Servers therefore ought to avoid
    backslash characters in entity tags.
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   An entity-tag can be more reliable for validation than a modification
   date in situations where it is inconvenient to store modification
   dates, where the one-second resolution of HTTP date values is not
   sufficient, or where modification dates are not consistently maintained.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
  Examples:
</preamble>
<artwork type="example">
  ETag: "xyzzy"
  ETag: W/"xyzzy"
  ETag: ""
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   An entity-tag can be either a weak or strong validator, with
   strong being the default.  If an origin server provides an entity-tag
   for a representation and the generation of that entity-tag does not satisfy
   the requirements for a strong validator
   (<xref target="weak.and.strong.validators"/>), then that
   entity-tag &MUST; be marked as weak by prefixing its opaque value
   with "W/" (case-sensitive).
</t>

<section title="Generation" anchor="entity.tag.generation">
<t>
   The principle behind entity-tags is that only the service author
   knows the implementation of a resource well enough to select the
   most accurate and efficient validation mechanism for that resource,
   and that any such mechanism can be mapped to a simple sequence of
   octets for easy comparison.  Since the value is opaque, there is no
   need for the client to be aware of how each entity-tag is constructed.
</t>
<t>
   For example, a resource that has implementation-specific versioning
   applied to all changes might use an internal revision number, perhaps
   combined with a variance identifier for content negotiation, to
   accurately differentiate between representations.
   Other implementations might use a collision-resistant hash of
   representation content,
   a combination of various filesystem attributes, or a modification
   timestamp that has sub-second resolution.
</t>
<t>
   Origin servers &SHOULD; send ETag for any selected representation
   for which detection of changes can be reasonably and consistently
   determined, since the entity-tag's use in conditional requests and
   evaluating cache freshness (&caching;) can result in a substantial
   reduction of HTTP network traffic and can be a significant factor in
   improving service scalability and reliability.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Comparison" anchor="entity.tag.comparison">
  <x:anchor-alias value="validator.comparison"/>
<t>
   There are two entity-tag comparison functions, depending
   on whether the comparison context allows the use of weak validators
   or not:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>The strong comparison function: in order to be considered equal,
        both opaque-tags &MUST; be identical character-by-character, and both
        &MUST-NOT; be weak.</t>
     <t>The weak comparison function: in order to be considered equal, both
        opaque-tags &MUST; be identical character-by-character, but
        either or both of them &MAY; be tagged as "weak" without affecting
        the result.</t>

<section title="Example: Entity-tags varying on Content-Negotiated Resources" anchor="example.entity.tag.vs.conneg">
<t>
   Consider a resource that is subject to content negotiation (&content-negotiation;),

GET /index HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

<t>
   In this case, the response might or might not use the gzip content coding.
   If it does not, the response might look like:
</t>
<figure><preamble>>> Response:</preamble><artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;response&#34;"  x:indent-with="  ">

<x:note>
  <t>
    &Note; Content codings are a property of the representation,
    so therefore an entity-tag of an encoded representation has to be distinct
    from an unencoded representation to prevent conflicts during cache updates
    and range requests.  In contrast, transfer codings (&transfer-codings;)
    apply only during message transfer and do not require distinct entity-tags.

<section title="Rules for When to Use Entity-tags and Last-Modified Dates" anchor="rules.for.when.to.use.entity.tags.and.last-modified.dates">
<t>
   We adopt a set of rules and recommendations for origin servers,
   clients, and caches regarding when various validator types ought to
   be used, and for what purposes.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 origin servers:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>&SHOULD; send an entity-tag validator unless it is not feasible to
        generate one.</t>

     <t>&MAY; send a weak entity-tag instead of a strong entity-tag, if
        performance considerations support the use of weak entity-tags,
        or if it is unfeasible to send a strong entity-tag.</t>

     <t>&SHOULD; send a <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> value if it is feasible to
        send one.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   In other words, the preferred behavior for an HTTP/1.1 origin server
   is to send both a strong entity-tag and a <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> value.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 clients:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>&MUST; use that entity-tag in any cache-conditional request (using
        <x:ref>If-Match</x:ref> or <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref>) if an
        entity-tag has been provided by the origin server.</t>

     <t>&SHOULD; use the <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> value in non-subrange
        cache-conditional requests (using <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref>)
        if only a Last-Modified value has been provided by the origin server.</t>

     <t>&MAY; use the <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> value in subrange
        cache-conditional requests (using <x:ref>If-Unmodified-Since</x:ref>)
        if only a Last-Modified value has been provided by an HTTP/1.0 origin
        server. The user agent &SHOULD; provide a way to disable this, in case
        of difficulty.</t>

     <t>&SHOULD; use both validators in cache-conditional requests if both an
        entity-tag and a <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> value have been provided
        by the origin server. This allows both HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 caches to
        respond appropriately.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 origin server, upon receiving a conditional request that
   includes both a Last-Modified date (e.g., in an <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref>
   or <x:ref>If-Unmodified-Since</x:ref> header field) and one or more
   entity-tags (e.g., in an <x:ref>If-Match</x:ref>, <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref>,
   or <x:ref>If-Range</x:ref> header field) as cache validators, &MUST-NOT;
   return a response status code of <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> unless
   doing so is consistent with all of the conditional header fields in the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP/1.1 caching proxy, upon receiving a conditional request that
   includes both a Last-Modified date and one or more entity-tags as
   cache validators, &MUST-NOT; return a locally cached response to the
   client unless that cached response is consistent with all of the
   conditional header fields in the request.
  <list><t>
      &Note; The general principle behind these rules is that HTTP/1.1
      servers and clients ought to transmit as much non-redundant
      information as is available in their responses and requests.
      HTTP/1.1 systems receiving this information will make the most
      conservative assumptions about the validators they receive.
  </t><t>
      HTTP/1.0 clients and caches might ignore entity-tags. Generally,
      last-modified values received or used by these systems will
      support transparent and efficient caching, and so HTTP/1.1 origin
      servers still ought to provide Last-Modified values.

<section title="Precondition Header Fields" anchor="header.field.definitions">
<t>
   This section defines the syntax and semantics of HTTP/1.1 header fields
   for applying preconditions on requests.
   <xref target="precedence"/> defines the order of evaluation when
   more than one precondition is present in a request.
</t>

<section title="If-Match" anchor="header.if-match">
  <iref primary="true" item="If-Match header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="If-Match" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="If-Match"/>
<t>
   The "If-Match" header field can be used to make a request method conditional
   on the current existence or value of an entity-tag for one or more
   representations of the target resource.
</t>
<t>
   If-Match is generally useful for resource update requests, such as PUT
   requests, as a means for protecting against accidental overwrites when
   multiple clients are acting in parallel on the same resource (i.e., the
   "lost update" problem).  An If-Match field-value of "*" places the
   precondition on the existence of any current representation for the
   target resource.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="If-Match"/>
  <x:ref>If-Match</x:ref> = "*" / 1#<x:ref>entity-tag</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The If-Match condition is met if and only if any of the entity-tags listed
   in the If-Match field value match the entity-tag of the selected
   representation for the target resource (as per <xref
   target="entity.tag.comparison"/>), or if "*" is given and any current
   representation exists for the target resource.
</t>
<t>
   If the condition is met, the server &MAY; perform the request method as if
   the If-Match header field was not present.
</t>
<t>
   Origin servers &MUST-NOT; perform the requested method if the condition is
   not met; instead they &MUST; respond with the <x:ref>412 (Precondition
   Failed)</x:ref> status code.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy servers using a cached response as the selected representation
   &MUST-NOT; perform the requested method if the condition is not met;
   instead, they &MUST; forward the request towards the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   If the request would, without the If-Match header field, result in
   anything other than a <x:ref>2xx (Successful)</x:ref> or <x:ref>412 (Precondition Failed)</x:ref>
   status code, then the If-Match header field &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<t>
   Examples:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  If-Match: "xyzzy"
  If-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"

<section title="If-None-Match" anchor="header.if-none-match">
  <iref primary="true" item="If-None-Match header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="If-None-Match" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="If-None-Match"/>
<t>
   The "If-None-Match" header field can be used to make a request method
   conditional on not matching any of the current entity-tag values for
   representations of the target resource.
</t>
<t>
   If-None-Match is primarily used in conditional GET requests to enable
   efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction
   overhead. A client that has one or more representations previously obtained
   from the target resource can send If-None-Match with a list of the
   associated entity-tags in the hope of receiving a <x:ref>304 (Not
   Modified)</x:ref> response if at least one of those representations matches
   the selected representation.
</t>
<t>
   If-None-Match can also be used with a value of "*" to prevent an unsafe
   request method (e.g., PUT) from inadvertently modifying an existing
   representation of the target resource when the client believes that
   the resource does not have a current representation.  This is a variation
   on the "lost update" problem that might arise if more than one client
   attempts to create an initial representation for the target resource.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="If-None-Match"/>
  <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref> = "*" / 1#<x:ref>entity-tag</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The If-None-Match condition is met if and only if none of the entity-tags
   listed in the If-None-Match field value match the entity-tag of the selected
   representation for the target resource (as per <xref
   target="entity.tag.comparison"/>), or if "*" is given and no current
   representation exists for that resource.
</t>
<t>
   If the condition is not met, the server &MUST-NOT; perform the requested
   method. Instead, if the request method was GET or HEAD, the server &SHOULD;
   respond with a <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> status code, including the
   cache-related header fields (particularly <x:ref>ETag</x:ref>) of the
   selected representation that has a matching entity-tag. For all other
   request methods, the server &MUST; respond with a <x:ref>412 (Precondition
   Failed)</x:ref> status code.
</t>
<t>
   If the condition is met, the server &MAY; perform the requested method
   as if the If-None-Match header field did not exist, but &MUST; also ignore
   any <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref> header field(s) in the request. That
   is, if no entity-tags match, then the server &MUST-NOT; return a <x:ref>304
   (Not Modified)</x:ref> response.
</t>
<t>
   If the request would, without the If-None-Match header field, result
   in anything other than a <x:ref>2xx (Successful)</x:ref> or
   <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref> status code, then the If-None-Match
   header field &MUST; be ignored. (See <xref
   target="rules.for.when.to.use.entity.tags.and.last-modified.dates"/> for
   a discussion of server behavior when both <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref>
   and If-None-Match appear in the same request.)

   The "If-Modified-Since" header field can be used with GET or HEAD to make
   the method conditional by modification date: if the selected representation

   do not perform the request method; instead, respond as detailed below.

   The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached

  <list><t>
      &Note; The <x:ref>Range</x:ref> header field modifies the meaning of
      If-Modified-Since; see &header-range; for full details.
    </t><t>
      &Note; If-Modified-Since times are interpreted by the server, whose
      clock might not be synchronized with the client.
    </t><t>
      &Note; When handling an If-Modified-Since header field, some
      servers will use an exact date comparison function, rather than a
      less-than function, for deciding whether to send a <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref>
      response. To get best results when sending an If-Modified-Since
      header field for cache validation, clients are
      advised to use the exact date string received in a previous
      <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref> header field whenever possible.
    </t><t>
      &Note; If a client uses an arbitrary date in the If-Modified-Since
      header field instead of a date taken from the <x:ref>Last-Modified</x:ref>
      header field for the same request, the client needs to be aware that this
      date is interpreted in the server's understanding of time.
      Unsynchronized clocks and rounding problems, due to the different
      encodings of time between the client and server, are concerns.
      This includes the possibility of race conditions if the
      document has changed between the time it was first requested and
      the If-Modified-Since date of a subsequent request, and the
      possibility of clock-skew-related problems if the If-Modified-Since
      date is derived from the client's clock without correction
      to the server's clock. Corrections for different time bases
      between client and server are at best approximate due to network
      latency.

   The 304 status code indicates that a conditional GET request has been
   received and would have resulted in a <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref> response if it were not
   for the fact that the condition has evaluated to false.  In other words,
   there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the
   target resource because the client's request indicates that it already
   has a valid representation, as indicated by the 304 response header
   fields, and is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that
   stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 response.
   The 304 response &MUST-NOT; contain a message-body, and thus is always
   terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
</t>
<t>
   A 304 response &MUST; include a <x:ref>Date</x:ref> header field
   (&header-date;) unless the origin server does not have a clock that can
   provide a reasonable approximation of the current time.  If a <x:ref>200
   (OK)</x:ref> response to the same request would have included any of the
   header fields <x:ref>Cache-Control</x:ref>, <x:ref>Content-Location</x:ref>,
   <x:ref>ETag</x:ref>, <x:ref>Expires</x:ref>, or <x:ref>Vary</x:ref>, then
   those same header fields &MUST; be sent in a 304 response.
</t>
<t>
   Since the goal of a 304 response is to minimize information transfer
   when the recipient already has one or more cached representations,
   the response &SHOULD-NOT; include representation metadata other
   than the above listed fields unless said metadata exists for the
   purpose of guiding cache updates (e.g., future HTTP extensions).
</t>
<t>
   If the recipient of a 304 response does not have a cached representation
   corresponding to the entity-tag indicated by the 304 response, then the
   recipient &MUST-NOT; use the 304 to update its own cache.  If this
   conditional request originated with an outbound client, such as a user agent
   with its own cache sending a conditional GET to a shared proxy, then the 304
   response &MAY; be forwarded to that client.  Otherwise, the recipient &MUST;
   disregard the 304 response and repeat the request without any preconditions.
</t>
<t>
   If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the
   cache &MUST; update the entry to reflect any new field values given in
   the response.

<section title="412 Precondition Failed" anchor="status.412">
  <iref primary="true" item="412 Precondition Failed (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="412 Precondition Failed" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="412 (Precondition Failed)"/>
<t>
   The 412 status code indicates that one or more preconditions given in
   the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.
   This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the
   current resource state (its current representations and metadata)
   and thus prevent the request method from being applied if the target
   resource is in an unexpected state.

<section title="Precedence" anchor="precedence">
<t>
   When more than one conditional request header field is present in a request,
   the order in which the fields are evaluated becomes important. In practice,
   the fields defined in this document are consistently implemented in a
   single, logical order, due to the fact that entity tags are presumed to be
   more accurate than date validators. For example, the only reason to send
   both <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref> and <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref> in the same GET request is to
   support intermediary caches that might not have implemented <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref>,
   so it makes sense to ignore the <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref> when entity tags are
   understood and available for the selected representation.
</t>
<t>
   The general rule of conditional precedence is that exact match conditions
   are evaluated before cache-validating conditions and, within that order, 
   last-modified conditions are only evaluated if the corresponding
   entity tag condition is not present (or not applicable because the
   selected representation does not have an entity tag).
</t>
<t>
   Specifically, the fields defined by this specification are evaluated
   as follows:
   <list style="numbers">
     <t>When <x:ref>If-Match</x:ref> is present, evaluate it:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>if true, continue to step 3</t>
         <t>if false, respond <x:ref>412 (Precondition Failed)</x:ref></t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>When <x:ref>If-Match</x:ref> is not present and
        <x:ref>If-Unmodified-Since</x:ref> is present, evaluate it:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>if true, continue to step 3</t>
         <t>if false, respond <x:ref>412 (Precondition Failed)</x:ref></t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>When the method is GET and both <x:ref>Range</x:ref> and
        <x:ref>If-Range</x:ref> are present, evaluate it:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>if the validator matches, respond 206 (Partial Content)</t>
         <t>if the validator does not match, respond <x:ref>200 (OK)</x:ref></t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>When <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref> is present, evaluate it:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>if true, all conditions are met</t>
         <t>if false for GET/HEAD, respond <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref></t>
         <t>if false for other methods, respond <x:ref>412 (Precondition Failed)</x:ref></t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>When the method is GET or HEAD,
        <x:ref>If-None-Match</x:ref> is not present, and
        <x:ref>If-Modified-Since</x:ref> is present, evaluate it:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>if true, all conditions are met</t>
         <t>if false, respond <x:ref>304 (Not Modified)</x:ref></t>
       </list>
     </t>
   </list>
</t>
<t>
   Any extension to HTTP/1.1 that defines additional conditional request
   header fields ought to define its own expectations regarding the order
   for evaluating such fields in relation to those defined in this document
   and other conditionals that might be found in practice.

   No additional security considerations have been identified beyond

</t>
<t>
   The validators defined by this specification are not intended to ensure
   the validity of a representation, guard against malicious changes, or
   detect man-in-the-middle attacks. At best, they enable more efficient cache
   updates and optimistic concurrent writes when all participants are behaving
   nicely. At worst, the conditions will fail and the client will receive a
   response that is no more harmful than an HTTP exchange without conditional
   requests.
