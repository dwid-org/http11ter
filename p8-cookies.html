      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.1">If a user agent receives a Set-Cookie2 response header whose NAME is the same as that of a cookie it has previously stored,
         the new cookie supersedes the old when: the old and new Domain attribute values compare equal, using a case-insensitive string-compare;
         and, the old and new Path attribute values string-compare equal (case-sensitive). However, if the Set-Cookie2 has a value
         for Max-Age of zero, the (old and new) cookie is discarded. Otherwise a cookie persists (resources permitting) until whichever
         happens first, then gets discarded: its Max-Age lifetime is exceeded; or, if the Discard attribute is set, the user agent
         terminates the session.

      <ul>
         <li>the user agent receives a cookie that contains a CommentURL attribute;</li>

         <li>the dialog allows the user to follow the CommentURL link when the user agent receives the cookie; and,</li>
         <li>when the user follows the CommentURL link, the origin server (or another server, via other links in the returned content)
            returns another cookie.

         an additional layer of complexity where adequate safeguards exist, however, this document distinguishes between transactions
         that are verifiable and those that are unverifiable. A transaction is verifiable if the user, or a user-designated agent,
         has the option to review the request-URI prior to its use in the transaction. A transaction is unverifiable if the user does
         not have that option. Unverifiable transactions typically arise when a user agent automatically requests inlined or embedded
         entities or when it resolves redirection (3xx) responses from an origin server. Typically the origin transaction, the transaction
         that the user initiates, is verifiable, and that transaction may directly or indirectly induce the user agent to make unverifiable
         transactions.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.2">An unverifiable transaction is to a third-party host if its request-host U does not domain-match the reach R of the request-host

      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.3">When it makes an unverifiable transaction, a user agent <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> disable all cookie processing (i.e., <em class="bcp14">MUST NOT</em> send cookies, and <em class="bcp14">MUST NOT</em> accept any received cookies) if the transaction is to a third-party host.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.4">This restriction prevents a malicious service author from using unverifiable transactions to induce a user agent to start
         or continue a session with a server in a different domain. The starting or continuation of such sessions could be contrary
         to the privacy expectations of the user, and could also be a security problem.

      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.7">Many current user agents already provide a review option that would render many links verifiable. For instance, some user
         agents display the URL that would be referenced for a particular link when the mouse pointer is placed over that link. The
         user can therefore determine whether to visit that site before causing the browser to do so. (Though not implemented on current
         user agents, a similar technique could be used for a button used to submit a form -- the user agent could display the action
         to be taken if the user were to select that button.) However, even this would not make all links verifiable; for example,
         links to automatically loaded images would not normally be subject to "mouse pointer" verification.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.3.3.6.p.8">Many user agents also provide the option for a user to view the HTML source of a document, or to save the source to an external
         file where it can be viewed by another application. While such an option does provide a crude review mechanism, some users
         might not consider it acceptable for this purpose.

      </h2>
      <p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">Caching benefits the scalability of WWW. Therefore it is important to reduce the number of documents that have state embedded
         in them inherently. For example, if a shopping-basket-style application always displays a user's current basket contents on
         each page, those pages cannot be cached, because each user's basket's contents would be different. On the other hand, if each
         page contains just a link that allows the user to "Look at My Shopping Basket", the page can be cached.

      <p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">Practical user agent implementations have limits on the number and size of cookies that they can store. In general, user agents'
         cookie support should have no fixed limits. They should strive to store as many frequently-used cookies as possible. Furthermore,
         general-use user agents <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> provide each of the following minimum capabilities individually, although not necessarily simultaneously: 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>at least 300 cookies</li>
         <li>at least 4096 bytes per cookie (as measured by the characters that comprise the cookie non-terminal in the syntax description
            of the Set-Cookie2 header, and as received in the Set-Cookie2 header)

      <p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">User agents created for specific purposes or for limited-capacity devices <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> provide at least 20 cookies of 4096 bytes, to ensure that the user can interact with a session-based origin server.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">The information in a Set-Cookie2 response header <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> be retained in its entirety. If for some reason there is inadequate space to store the cookie, it <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> be discarded, not truncated.

         cookie information. Otherwise a malicious server could attempt to flood a user agent with many cookies, or large cookies,
         on successive responses, which would force out cookies the user agent had received from other servers. However, the minima

      <p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Informed consent should guide the design of systems that use cookies. A user should be able to find out how a web site plans
         to use information in a cookie and should be able to choose whether or not those policies are acceptable. Both the user agent
         and the origin server must assist informed consent.

      <h2 id="rfc.section.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1</a>&nbsp;User Agent Control
      </h2>
      <p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">An origin server could create a Set-Cookie2 header to track the path of a user through the server. Users may object to this
         behavior as an intrusive accumulation of information, even if their identity is not evident. (Identity might become evident,
         for example, if a user subsequently fills out a form that contains identifying information.) This state management specification
         therefore requires that a user agent give the user control over such a possible intrusion, although the interface through
         which the user is given this control is left unspecified. However, the control mechanisms provided <em class="bcp14">SHALL</em> at least allow the user 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>to completely disable the sending and saving of cookies.</li>
         <li>to determine whether a stateful session is in progress.</li>
         <li>to control the saving of a cookie on the basis of the cookie's Domain attribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">Such control could be provided, for example, by mechanisms </p>
      <ul>
         <li>to notify the user when the user agent is about to send a cookie to the origin server, to offer the option not to begin a
            session.
         </li>
         <li>to display a visual indication that a stateful session is in progress.</li>
         <li>to let the user decide which cookies, if any, should be saved when the user concludes a window or user agent session.</li>
         <li>to let the user examine and delete the contents of a cookie at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">A user agent usually begins execution with no remembered state information. It <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> be possible to configure a user agent never to send Cookie headers, in which case it can never sustain state with an origin
         server. (The user agent would then behave like one that is unaware of how to handle Set-Cookie2 response headers.)
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">When the user agent terminates execution, it <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> let the user discard all state information. Alternatively, the user agent <em class="bcp14">MAY</em> ask the user whether state information should be retained; the default should be "no". If the user chooses to retain state
         information, it would be restored the next time the user agent runs.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.5">NOTE: User agents should probably be cautious about using files to store cookies long-term. If a user runs more than one instance
         of the user agent, the cookies could be commingled or otherwise corrupted.

         of the opportunity to provide richer information in a multiplicity of languages.

         the ways that cookies can "leak" to the "wrong" site. The intent is to restrict cookies to one host, or a closely related
         set of hosts. Therefore a request-host is limited as to what values it can set for Domain. We consider it acceptable for hosts
         host1.foo.com and host2.foo.com to share cookies, but not a.com and b.com.
      </p>

      <ol>
         <li>User agent makes request to victim.cracker.edu, gets back cookie session_id="1234" and sets the default domain victim.cracker.edu.</li>
         <li>User agent makes request to spoof.cracker.edu, gets back cookie session-id="1111", with Domain=".cracker.edu".</li>

      <p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.1">A user agent <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> make every attempt to prevent the sharing of session information between hosts that are in different domains. Embedded or
         inlined objects may cause particularly severe privacy problems if they can be used to share cookies between disparate hosts.

      </h1>
      <p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">Apart from RFC 2109, three other proposals have been made to accomplish similar goals. This specification began as an amalgam
         of Kristol's State-Info proposal <a href="#DMK95" id="rfc.xref.DMK95.1"><cite title="Proposed HTTP State-Info Mechanism">[DMK95]</cite></a> and Netscape's Cookie proposal <a href="#Netscape" id="rfc.xref.Netscape.2"><cite title="Persistent Client State -- HTTP Cookies">[Netscape]</cite></a>.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Brian Behlendorf proposed a Session-ID header that would be user-agent-initiated and could be used by an origin server to
         track "clicktrails". It would not carry any origin-server-defined state, however. Phillip Hallam-Baker has proposed another
         client-defined session ID mechanism for similar purposes.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">While both session IDs and cookies can provide a way to sustain stateful sessions, their intended purpose is different, and,
         consequently, the privacy requirements for them are different. A user initiates session IDs to allow servers to track progress
         through them, or to distinguish multiple users on a shared machine. Cookies are server-initiated, so the cookie mechanism
         described here gives users control over something that would otherwise take place without the users' awareness. Furthermore,
         cookies convey rich, server-selected information, whereas session IDs comprise user-selected, simple information.

      </h2>
      <p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.1">Existing cookie implementations, based on the Netscape specification, use the Set-Cookie (not Set-Cookie2) header. User agents
         that receive in the same response both a Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 response header for the same cookie <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> discard the Set-Cookie information and use only the Set-Cookie2 information. Furthermore, a user agent <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> assume, if it received a Set-Cookie2 response header, that the sending server complies with this document and will understand
         Cookie request headers that also follow this specification.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.2">New cookies <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> replace both equivalent old- and new-style cookies. That is, if a user agent that follows both this specification and Netscape's
         original specification receives a Set-Cookie2 response header, and the NAME and the Domain and Path attributes match (per
         the Cookie Management section) a Netscape-style cookie, the Netscape-style cookie <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> be discarded, and the user agent <em class="bcp14">MUST</em> retain only the cookie adhering to this specification.
      </p>
      <p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.3">Older user agents that do not understand this specification, but that do understand Netscape's original specification, will

      <p id="rfc.section.10.1.p.4">A user agent that supports both this specification and Netscape-style cookies <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> send a Cookie request header that follows the older Netscape specification if it received the cookie in a Set-Cookie response
         header and not in a Set-Cookie2 response header. However, it <em class="bcp14">SHOULD</em> send the following request header as well:

      <h2 id="rfc.section.10.2"><a href="#rfc.section.10.2">10.2</a>&nbsp;Caching and HTTP/1.0
      </h2>
      <p id="rfc.section.10.2.p.1">Some caches, such as those conforming to HTTP/1.0, will inevitably cache the Set-Cookie2 and Set-Cookie headers, because there
         was no mechanism to suppress caching of headers prior to HTTP/1.1. This caching can lead to security problems. Documents transmitted
         by an origin server along with Set-Cookie2 and Set-Cookie headers usually either will be uncachable, or will be "pre-expired".
         As long as caches obey instructions not to cache documents (following Expires: &lt;a date in the past&gt; or Pragma: no-cache (HTTP/1.0),
         or Cache-control: no-cache (HTTP/1.1)) uncachable documents present no problem. However, pre-expired documents may be stored
         in caches. They require validation (a conditional GET) on each new request, but some cache operators loosen the rules for
         their caches, and sometimes serve expired documents without first validating them. This combination of factors can lead to
         cookies meant for one user later being sent to another user. The Set-Cookie2 and Set-Cookie headers are stored in the cache,
         and, although the document is stale (expired), the cache returns the document in response to later requests, including cached
         headers.
