<abstract>
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for
   distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. HTTP has been in
   use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This
   document is Part 2 of the seven-part specification that defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, obsoletes RFC 2616.
</t>
<t>
   Part 2 defines the semantics of HTTP messages as expressed by request
   methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header
   fields. Furthermore, it defines HTTP message content, metadata, and content
   negotiation.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
   This document defines HTTP/1.1 request and response semantics.  Each HTTP
   message, as defined in &messaging;, is in the form of either a request or
   a response.  An HTTP server listens on a connection for HTTP requests and
   responds to each request, in the order received on that connection, with
   one or more HTTP response messages.  This document defines the commonly
   agreed upon semantics of the HTTP uniform interface, the intentions defined
   by each request method, and the various response messages that might be
   expected as a result of applying that method to the target resource.
</t>
<t>
   Furthermore, it defines HTTP/1.1 message payloads (a.k.a., content), the
   associated metadata header fields that define how the payload is intended
   to be interpreted by a recipient, the request header fields that
   might influence content selection, and the various selection algorithms
   that are collectively referred to as HTTP content negotiation.
   <cref>#351</cref>
</t>
<t>
   This document is currently disorganized in order to minimize the changes
   between drafts and enable reviewers to see the smaller errata changes.
   A future draft will reorganize the sections to better reflect the content.
   In particular, the sections will be ordered according to the typical
   processing of an HTTP request message (after message parsing): resource
   mapping, methods, request modifying header fields, response status,
   status modifying header fields, and resource metadata.  The current mess
   reflects how widely dispersed these topics and associated requirements
   had become in <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
</t>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
<t>
   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   played by participants in, and objects of, the HTTP communication.
</t>
<t>
  <iref item="content negotiation"/>
  <x:dfn>content negotiation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when
      servicing a request. The representation in any response
      can be negotiated (including error responses).
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  <iref primary="true" item="selected representation"/>
  <x:dfn>selected representation</x:dfn>
  <list>
    <t>
      The current representation of the target resource that would have been
      selected in a successful response if the same request had used the
      method GET and excluded any conditional request header fields.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conformance and Error Handling" anchor="intro.conformance.and.error.handling">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

   This document defines conformance criteria for several roles in HTTP
   communication, including Senders, Recipients, Clients, Servers, User-Agents,
   Origin Servers, Intermediaries, Proxies and Gateways. See &architecture;
   for definitions of these terms.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is considered conformant if it complies with all of the
   requirements associated with its role(s). Note that SHOULD-level requirements
   are relevant here, unless one of the documented exceptions is applicable.
</t>
<t>
   This document also uses ABNF to define valid protocol elements
   (<xref target="notation"/>). In addition to the prose requirements placed
   upon them, Senders &MUST-NOT; generate protocol elements that are invalid.
</t>
<t>
   Unless noted otherwise, Recipients &MAY; take steps to recover a usable
   protocol element from an invalid construct. However, HTTP does not define
   specific error handling mechanisms, except in cases where it has direct
   impact on security. This is because different uses of the protocol require
   different error handling strategies; for example, a Web browser may wish to
   transparently recover from a response where the Location header field
   doesn't parse according to the ABNF, whereby in a systems control protocol
   using HTTP, this type of error recovery could lead to dangerous consequences.

   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   Allow header field (<xref target="header.allow"/>). The status code of the response
   always notifies the client whether a method is currently allowed on a
   resource, since the set of allowed methods can change dynamically. An
   origin server &SHOULD; respond with the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD &MUST; be supported by all general-purpose servers. All other
   methods are &OPTIONAL;; however, if the above methods are implemented,
   they &MUST; be implemented with the same semantics as those specified
   in <xref target="method.definitions"/>.

<section title="Safe and Idempotent Methods" anchor="safe.and.idempotent">

<section title="Safe Methods" anchor="safe.methods">
<iref item="Safe Methods" primary="true"/>
<t>
   Implementors need to be aware that the software represents the user in
   their interactions over the Internet, and need to allow
   the user to be aware of any actions they take which might have an
   unexpected significance to themselves or others.
</t>
<t>
   In particular, the convention has been established that the GET, HEAD,
   OPTIONS, and TRACE request methods &SHOULD-NOT; have the significance
   of taking an action other than retrieval. These request methods ought
   to be considered "<x:dfn anchor="safe">safe</x:dfn>".
   This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT
   and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the
   fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
</t>
<t>
   Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
   generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in
   fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important
   distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,
   so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Idempotent Methods" anchor="idempotent.methods">
<iref item="Idempotent Methods" primary="true"/>
<t>
   Request methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that,
   aside from error or expiration issues, the intended effect of multiple
   identical requests is the same as for a single request.
   PUT, DELETE, and all safe request methods are idempotent.
   It is important to note that idempotence refers only to changes
   requested by the client: a server is free to change its state due
   to multiple requests for the purpose of tracking those requests,
   versioning of results, etc.

<section title="Method Registry" anchor="method.registry">

<section title="Considerations for New Methods" anchor="considerations.for.new.methods">
<t>
   When it is necessary to express new semantics for a HTTP request that
   aren't specific to a single application or media type, and currently defined
   methods are inadequate, it may be appropriate to register a new method.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP methods are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to any
   resource, not just one particular media type, "type" of resource, or
   application. As such, it is preferred that new HTTP methods be registered
   in a document that isn't specific to a single application, so that this is
   clear.
</t>
<t>
   Due to the parsing rules defined in &message-body;, definitions of HTTP
   methods cannot prohibit the presence of a message body on either the request
   or the response message (with responses to HEAD requests being the single
   exception). Definitions of new methods cannot change this rule, but they can
   specify that only zero-length bodies (as opposed to absent bodies) are allowed.
</t>
<t>
   New method definitions need to indicate whether they are safe (<xref
   target="safe.methods"/>), what semantics (if any) the request body has,
   and whether they are idempotent (<xref target="idempotent.methods"/>). 
   They also need to state whether they can be cached (&caching;); in 
   particular what conditions a cache may store the response, and under what 
   conditions such a stored response may be used to satisfy a subsequent 
   request.

  <iref primary="true" item="OPTIONS method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="OPTIONS" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The OPTIONS method requests information about the
   communication options available on the request/response chain
   identified by the effective request URI. This method allows a client to
   determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,
   or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action
   or initiating a resource retrieval.
</t>
<t>
   Responses to the OPTIONS method are not cacheable.
</t>
<t>
   If the OPTIONS request includes a message body (as indicated by the
   presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type
   &MUST; be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this
   specification does not define any use for such a body, future
   extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed
   queries on the server.
</t>
<t>
   If the request-target (&request-target;) is an asterisk ("*"),
   the OPTIONS request is
   intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific
   resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on
   the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op"
   type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test
   the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test
   a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).
</t>
<t>
   If the request-target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
   only to the options that are available when communicating with that
   resource.
</t>
<t>
   A 200 response &SHOULD; include any header fields that indicate
   optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that
   resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by
   this specification. The response body, if any, &SHOULD; also include
   information about the communication options. The format for such a
   body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by
   future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation &MAY; be used to select
   the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the
   response &MUST; include a Content-Length field with a field-value of
   "0".
</t>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards header field &MAY; be used to target a
   specific proxy in the request chain (see <xref target="header.max-forwards"/>).
   If no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded
   request &MUST-NOT; include a Max-Forwards field.

<t>
   The GET method requests transfer of a current representation of
   the target resource.
</t>
<t>   
   If the target resource is a data-producing process, it is the
   produced data which shall be returned as the representation in the response and not
   the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of
   the process.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
   request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
   If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
   requests that the representation be transferred only under the
   circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
   conditional GET request is intended to reduce unnecessary network
   usage by allowing cached representations to be refreshed without requiring
   multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the
   request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
   that only part of the representation be transferred, as described in &header-range;.
   The partial GET request is intended to reduce unnecessary
   network usage by allowing partially-retrieved representations to be
   completed without transferring data already held by the client.
</t>
<t>
   Bodies on GET requests have no defined semantics. Note that sending a body
   on a GET request might cause some existing implementations to reject the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   The response to a GET request is cacheable and &MAY; be used to satisfy
   subsequent GET and HEAD requests (see &caching;).

<t>
   The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server &MUST-NOT;
   return a message body in the response. The metadata contained
   in the HTTP header fields in response to a HEAD request &SHOULD; be identical
   to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can
   be used for obtaining metadata about the representation implied by the
   request without transferring the representation body. This method is
   often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,
   and recent modification.
</t>
<t>
   The response to a HEAD request is cacheable and &MAY; be used to satisfy
   a subsequent HEAD request. It also has potential side effects on
   previously stored responses to GET; see &p6-head;.

<t>
   The POST method requests that the origin server accept the
   representation enclosed in the request as data to be processed by the 
   target resource. POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the
   following functions:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Annotation of existing resources;
    </t>
    <t>
        Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
        or similar group of articles;
    </t>
    <t>
        Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;
    </t>
    <t>
        Extending a database through an append operation.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
   server and is usually dependent on the effective request URI.
</t>
<t>
   The action performed by the POST method might not result in a
   resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200
   (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status code,
   depending on whether or not the response includes a representation that
   describes the result.
</t>
<t>
   If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
   &SHOULD; be 201 (Created) and contain a representation which describes the
   status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location
   header field (see <xref target="header.location"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they
   include explicit freshness information (see &p6-explicit;). A
   cached POST response with a Content-Location header field 
   (see &header-content-location;) whose value is the effective 
   Request URI &MAY; be used to satisfy subsequent GET and HEAD requests.
</t>
<t>
   Note that POST caching is not widely implemented. 
   However, the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the 
   user agent to retrieve a cacheable representation of the resource.

<section title="PUT" anchor="PUT">
  <iref primary="true" item="PUT method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="PUT" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource
   be created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
   enclosed in the request message payload.  A successful PUT of a given
   representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same target
   resource will result in an equivalent representation being returned in
   a 200 (OK) response.  However, there is no guarantee that such a state
   change will be observable, since the target resource might be acted
   upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic
   processing by the origin server, before any subsequent GET is received.
   A successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was
   achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.
</t>
<t>   
   If the target resource does not have a current representation and
   the PUT successfully creates one, then the origin server &MUST; inform
   the user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.  If the target
   resource does have a current representation and that representation is
   successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed
   representation, then either a 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response
   &SHOULD; be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.
</t>
<t>
   Unrecognized header fields &SHOULD; be ignored (i.e., not saved
   as part of the resource state).
</t>
<t>
   An origin server &SHOULD; verify that the PUT representation is
   consistent with any constraints which the server has for the target
   resource that cannot or will not be changed by the PUT.  This is
   particularly important when the origin server uses internal
   configuration information related to the URI in order to set the
   values for representation metadata on GET responses.  When a PUT
   representation is inconsistent with the target resource, the origin
   server &SHOULD; either make them consistent, by transforming the
   representation or changing the resource configuration, or respond
   with an appropriate error message containing sufficient information
   to explain why the representation is unsuitable.  The 409 (Conflict)
   or 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status codes are suggested, with the
   latter being specific to constraints on Content-Type values.
</t>
<t>
   For example, if the target resource is configured to always have a
   Content-Type of "text/html" and the representation being PUT has a
   Content-Type of "image/jpeg", then the origin server &SHOULD; do one of:
   (a) reconfigure the target resource to reflect the new media type;
   (b) transform the PUT representation to a format consistent with that
   of the resource before saving it as the new resource state; or,
   (c) reject the request with a 415 response indicating that the target
   resource is limited to "text/html", perhaps including a link to a
   different resource that would be a suitable target for the new
   representation.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP does not define exactly how a PUT method affects the state
   of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of
   the user agent request and the semantics of the origin server response.
   It does not define what a resource might be, in any sense of that
   word, beyond the interface provided via HTTP.  It does not define
   how resource state is "stored", nor how such storage might change
   as a result of a change in resource state, nor how the origin server
   translates resource state into representations.  Generally speaking,
   all implementation details behind the resource interface are
   intentionally hidden by the server.
</t>
<t>
   The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT methods is
   highlighted by the different intent for the target resource.
   The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the
   enclosed representation as a data-accepting process, such as for
   a gateway to some other protocol or a document that accepts annotations.
   In contrast, the target resource in a PUT request is intended to
   take the enclosed representation as a new or replacement value.
   Hence, the intent of PUT is idempotent and visible to intermediaries,
   even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   Proper interpretation of a PUT request presumes that the user agent
   knows what target resource is desired.  A service that is intended
   to select a proper URI on behalf of the client, after receiving
   a state-changing request, &SHOULD; be implemented using the POST
   method rather than PUT.  If the origin server will not make the
   requested PUT state change to the target resource and instead
   wishes to have it applied to a different resource, such as when the
   resource has been moved to a different URI, then the origin server
   &MUST; send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent &MAY;
   then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   A PUT request applied to the target resource &MAY; have side-effects
   on other resources.  For example, an article might have a URI for
   identifying "the current version" (a resource) which is separate
   from the URIs identifying each particular version (different
   resources that at one point shared the same state as the current version
   resource).  A successful PUT request on "the current version" URI might
   therefore create a new version resource in addition to changing the
   state of the target resource, and might also cause links to be added
   between the related resources.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server &SHOULD; reject any PUT request that contains a
   Content-Range header field, since it might be misinterpreted as
   partial content (or might be partial content that is being mistakenly
   PUT as a full representation).  Partial content updates are
   possible by targeting a separately identified resource with state
   that overlaps a portion of the larger resource, or by using a
   different method that has been specifically defined for partial
   updates (for example, the PATCH method defined in
   <xref target="RFC5789"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Responses to the PUT method are not cacheable. If a PUT request passes 
   through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the effective 
   request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated (see
   &p6-invalid;).

<t>
   The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the target
   resource. This method &MAY; be overridden by
   human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot
   be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
   status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action
   has been completed successfully. However, the server &SHOULD-NOT; 
   indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it
   intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible
   location.
</t>
<t>
   A successful response &SHOULD; be 200 (OK) if the response includes an
   representation describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not
   yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted
   but the response does not include a representation.
</t>
<t>
   Bodies on DELETE requests have no defined semantics. Note that sending a body
   on a DELETE request might cause some existing implementations to reject the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   Responses to the DELETE method are not cacheable. If a DELETE request

<t>
   The TRACE method requests a remote, application-layer loop-back
   of the request message. The final recipient of the request
   &SHOULD; reflect the message received back to the client as the
   message body of a 200 (OK) response. The final recipient is either the
   origin server or the first proxy to receive a Max-Forwards
   value of zero (0) in the request (see <xref target="header.max-forwards"/>).
   A TRACE request &MUST-NOT; include a message body.
</t>
<t>
   TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other
   end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic
   information. The value of the Via header field (&header-via;) is of
   particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the request chain.
   Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit the
   length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of
   proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop.
</t>

   If the request is valid, the response &SHOULD; have a Content-Type of

   The CONNECT method requests that the proxy establish a tunnel
   to the request-target and, if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior
   to blind forwarding of packets until the connection is closed.
</t>
<t>
   When using CONNECT, the request-target &MUST; use the authority form
   (&request-target;); i.e., the request-target consists of only the
   host name and port number of the tunnel destination, separated by a colon.
   For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;request&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com:80

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Any successful (2xx) response to a CONNECT request indicates that the
   proxy has established a connection to the requested host and port,
   and has switched to tunneling the current connection to that server
   connection.
   The tunneled data from the server begins immediately after the blank line
   that concludes the successful response's header block.
   A server &SHOULD-NOT; send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length
   header fields in a successful response.
   A client &MUST; ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header
   fields received in a successful response.
</t>
<t>
   Any response other than a successful response indicates that the tunnel
   has not yet been formed and that the connection remains governed by HTTP.
</t>
<t>
   Proxy authentication might be used to establish the
   authority to create a tunnel:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;request&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com:80
Proxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A message body on a CONNECT request has no defined semantics. Sending a
   body on a CONNECT request might cause existing implementations to reject
   the request.
</t>
<t>
   Similar to a pipelined HTTP/1.1 request, data to be tunneled from client
   to server &MAY; be sent immediately after the request (before a response
   is received). The usual caveats also apply:
   data may be discarded if the eventual response is negative, and the
   connection may be reset with no response if more than one TCP segment
   is outstanding.
</t>
<t>
   It may be the case that the proxy itself can only reach the requested
   origin server through another proxy.  In this case, the first proxy
   &SHOULD; make a CONNECT request of that next proxy, requesting a tunnel
   to the authority.  A proxy &MUST-NOT; respond with any 2xx status code
   unless it has either a direct or tunnel connection established to the
   authority.
</t>
<t>
   If at any point either one of the peers gets disconnected, any
   outstanding data that came from that peer will be passed to the other
   one, and after that also the other connection will be terminated by
   the proxy. If there is outstanding data to that peer undelivered,
   that data will be discarded.
</t>
<t>
   An origin server which receives a CONNECT request for itself &MAY;
   respond with a 2xx status code to indicate that a connection is
   established.  However, most origin servers do not implement CONNECT.

<section title="Header Fields" anchor="header.fields">
<t>
   Header fields are key value pairs that can be used to communicate data about
   the message, its payload, the target resource, or about the connection
   itself (i.e., control data).  See &header-fields; for a general definition
   of their syntax.
</t>

<section title="Considerations for Creating Header Fields" anchor="considerations.for.creating.header.fields">
<t>
   New header fields are registered using the procedures described in
   <xref target="RFC3864"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The requirements for header field names are defined in
   <xref target="RFC3864" x:fmt="of" x:sec="4.1"/>.  Authors of specifications
   defining new fields are advised to keep the name as short as practical, and
   not to prefix them with "X-" if they are to be registered (either
   immediately or in the future).
</t>
<t>
   New header field values typically have their syntax defined using ABNF
   (<xref target="RFC5234"/>), using the extension defined in &abnf-extension;
   as necessary, and are usually constrained to the range of ASCII characters.
   Header fields needing a greater range of characters can use an encoding
   such as the one defined in <xref target="RFC5987"/>. 
</t>
<t>
   Because commas (",") are used as a generic delimiter between field-values,
   they need to be treated with care if they are allowed in the field-value's
   payload. Typically, components that might contain a comma are protected with
   double-quotes using the quoted-string ABNF production (&field-components;). 
</t>
<t>
   For example, a textual date and a URI (either of which might contain a comma)
   could be safely carried in field-values like these:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Example-URI-Field: "http://example.com/a.html,foo",
                     "http://without-a-comma.example.com/"
  Example-Date-Field: "Sat, 04 May 1996", "Wed, 14 Sep 2005"
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Note that double quote delimiters almost always are used with the
   quoted-string production; using a different syntax inside double quotes
   will likely cause unnecessary confusion.
</t>
<t>
   Many header fields use a format including (case-insensitively) named
   parameters (for instance, Content-Type, defined in &header-content-type;).
   Allowing both unquoted (token) and quoted (quoted-string) syntax for the
   parameter value enables recipients to use existing parser components. When
   allowing both forms, the meaning of a parameter value ought to be
   independent of the syntax used for it (for an example, see the notes on
   parameter handling for media types in &media-types;).
</t>
<t>
   Authors of specifications defining new header fields are advised to consider
   documenting:
  <list style="symbols">
    <x:lt>
      <t>Whether the field is a single value, or whether it can be a list
      (delimited by commas; see &header-fields;).</t>
      <t>If it does not use the list syntax, document how to treat messages
      where the header field occurs multiple times (a sensible default would
      be to ignore the header field, but this might not always be the right
      choice).</t>
      <t>Note that intermediaries and software libraries might combine
      multiple header field instances into a single one, despite the header
      field not allowing this. A robust format enables recipients to discover
      these situations (good example: "Content-Type", as the comma can only
      appear inside quoted strings; bad example: "Location", as a comma can
      occur inside a URI).</t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>Under what conditions the header field can be used; e.g., only in
    responses or requests, in all messages, only on responses to a particular
    request method.</t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>Whether it is appropriate to list the field-name in the Connection header
    (i.e., if the header is to be hop-by-hop, see &header-connection;).</t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>Under what conditions intermediaries are allowed to modify the header
    field's value, insert or delete it.</t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>How the header might interact with caching (see <xref target="Part6"/>).</t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>Whether the header field is useful or allowable in trailers (see
    &chunked-encoding;).</t></x:lt>
    <x:lt><t>Whether the header field should be preserved across redirects.</t></x:lt>

<section title="Status Codes" anchor="status.codes">
<t>
   The status-code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to
   understand and satisfy the request.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
   to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications &MUST;
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
   x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
   unrecognized response &MUST-NOT; be cached. For example, if an
   unrecognized status code of 431 is received by the client, it can
   safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and
   treat the response as if it had received a 400 status code. In such
   cases, user agents &SHOULD; present to the user the representation enclosed
   with the response, since that representation is likely to include human-readable
   information which will explain the unusual status.
</t>
<t>
   The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response. The
   last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5
   values for the first digit:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process
    </t>
    <t>
      2xx: Success - The action was successfully received,
        understood, and accepted
    </t>
    <t>
      3xx: Redirection - Further action needs to be taken in order to
        complete the request
    </t>
    <t>
      4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot
        be fulfilled
    </t>
    <t>
      5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently
        valid request
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   For most status codes the response can carry a payload, in which case a
   Content-Type header field indicates the payload's media type
   (&header-content-type;).

<section title="Status Code Registry" anchor="status.code.registry">
<t>
  The HTTP Status Code Registry defines the name space for the status-code

</t>
<t>
  Values to be added to this name space require IETF Review
  (see <xref target="RFC5226" x:fmt="," x:sec="4.1"/>).
</t>
<t>
  The registry itself is maintained at <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes"/>.

<section title="Considerations for New Status Codes" anchor="considerations.for.new.status.codes">
<t>
   When it is necessary to express new semantics for a HTTP response that
   aren't specific to a single application or media type, and currently defined
   status codes are inadequate, a new status code can be registered.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP status codes are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to
   any resource, not just one particular media type, "type" of resource, or
   application. As such, it is preferred that new HTTP status codes be
   registered in a document that isn't specific to a single application, so
   that this is clear.
</t>
<t>
   Definitions of new HTTP status codes typically explain the request
   conditions that produce a response containing the status code (e.g.,
   combinations of request headers and/or method(s)), along with any 
   interactions with response headers (e.g., those that are required, those
   that modify the semantics of the response).
</t>
<t>
   New HTTP status codes are required to fall under one of the categories
   defined in <xref target="status.codes"/>. To allow existing parsers to
   properly handle them, new status codes cannot disallow a response body,
   although they can mandate a zero-length response body. They can require the
   presence of one or more particular HTTP response header(s).
</t>
<t>
   Likewise, their definitions can specify that caches are allowed to use
   heuristics to determine their freshness (see &caching;; by default, it is
   not allowed), and can define how to determine the resource which they
   carry a representation for (see <xref
   target="identifying.response.associated.with.representation"/>; by default,
   it is anonymous).
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Informational 1xx" anchor="status.1xx">
<t>
   This class of status code indicates a provisional response,
   consisting only of the status-line and optional header fields, and is
   terminated by an empty line. There are no required header fields for this
   class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status
   codes, servers &MUST-NOT; send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client
   except under experimental conditions.
</t>
<t>
   A client &MUST; be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses
   prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100
   (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses &MAY; be
   ignored by a user agent.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies &MUST; forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the
   proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself
   requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a
   proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request,
   then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue)
   response(s).)

<t>
   The client &SHOULD; continue with its request. This interim response is
   used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has
   been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client
   &SHOULD; continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the
   request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server
   &MUST; send a final response after the request has been completed. See
   &use100; for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this

<t>
   The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's
   request, via the Upgrade message header field (&header-upgrade;), for a
   change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The
   server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's
   Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which
   terminates the 101 response.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol &SHOULD; be switched only when it is advantageous to do
   so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous
   over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous
   protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use
   such features.

    <t hangText="HEAD">

    <t hangText="TRACE">
      a representation containing the request message as received by the
      end server.

  <iref primary="true" item="201 Created (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="201 Created" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in a new resource being
   created. 
</t>
<t>
   The newly created resource is typically linked to from the response payload,
   with the most relevant URI also being carried in the Location header field.
   If the newly created resource's URI is the same as the Effective Request URI,
   this information can be omitted (e.g., in the case of a response to a PUT
   request).  
</t>
<t>
   The origin server &MUST; create the resource before returning the 201 status
   code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server &SHOULD;
   respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.
</t>
<t>
   A 201 response &MAY; contain an ETag response header field indicating
   the current value of the entity-tag for the representation of the resource
   just created (see &header-etag;).
</t>
</section>

<section title="202 Accepted" anchor="status.202">
  <iref primary="true" item="202 Accepted (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="202 Accepted" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has
   not been completed.  The request might or might not eventually be
   acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes
   place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an
   asynchronous operation such as this.
</t>
<t>
   The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to
   allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a
   batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without
   requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist
   until the process is completed. The representation returned with this
   response &SHOULD; include an indication of the request's current status
   and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the
   user can expect the request to be fulfilled.

   The representation in the response has been transformed or otherwise

   This status code is only appropriate when the response status code would

<section title="204 No Content" anchor="status.204">
  <iref primary="true" item="204 No Content (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="204 No Content" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The 204 (No Content) status code indicates that the server has
   successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional
   content to return in the response payload body.  Metadata in the
   response header fields refer to the target resource and its current
   representation after the requested action.
</t>
<t>
   For example, if a 204 status code is received in response to a PUT
   request and the response contains an ETag header field, then the PUT
   was successful and the ETag field-value contains the entity-tag for
   the new representation of that target resource.
</t>
<t>
   The 204 response allows a server to indicate that the action has been
   successfully applied to the target resource while implying that the
   user agent &SHOULD-NOT; traverse away from its current "document view"
   (if any).  The server assumes that the user agent will provide some
   indication of the success to its user, in accord with its own interface,
   and apply any new or updated metadata in the response to the active
   representation.
</t>
<t>
   For example, a 204 status code is commonly used with document editing
   interfaces corresponding to a "save" action, such that the document
   being saved remains available to the user for editing. It is also
   frequently used with interfaces that expect automated data transfers
   to be prevalent, such as within distributed version control systems.
</t>
<t>
   The 204 response &MUST-NOT; include a message body, and thus is always
   terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
</t>

<t>
   The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent &SHOULD; reset
   the document view which caused the request to be sent. This response
   is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place via
   user input, followed by a clearing of the form in which the input is
   given so that the user can easily initiate another input action.
</t>

   The message body included with the response &MUST; be empty. Note that
   receivers still need to parse the response according to the algorithm defined

<section title="Redirection 3xx" anchor="status.3xx">
<t>
   This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be
   taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  If the required
   action involves a subsequent HTTP request, it &MAY; be carried out by the
   user agent without interaction with the user if and only if the method used
   in the second request is known to be "safe", as defined in
   <xref target="safe.methods"/>.
</t>
<t>
   There are several types of redirects:
   <list style="numbers">
      <x:lt>
        <t>
          Redirects of the request to another URI, either temporarily or
          permanently. The new URI is specified in the Location header field.
          In this specification, the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently), 
          302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect) fall under this category.
        </t>
      </x:lt>
      <x:lt>
        <t>
          Redirection to a new location that represents an indirect response to
          the request, such as the result of a POST operation to be retrieved
          with a subsequent GET request. This is status code 303 (See Other).
        </t>
      </x:lt>
      <x:lt>
        <t>
          Redirection offering a choice of matching resources for use by
          agent-driven content negotiation (&agent-driven-negotiation;). This
          is status code 300 (Multiple Choices).
        </t>
      </x:lt>
      <x:lt>
        <t>
          Other kinds of redirection, such as to a cached result (status code 304
          (Not Modified), see &status-304;). 
        </t>
      </x:lt>
   </list>
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> In HTTP/1.0, only the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently)
    and 302 (Found) were defined for the first type of redirect, and the second
    type did not exist at all (<xref target="RFC1945" x:fmt="," x:sec="9.3"/>).
    However it turned out that web forms using POST expected redirects to change
    the operation for the subsequent request to retrieval (GET). To address this
    use case, HTTP/1.1 introduced the second type of redirect with the status
    code 303 (See Other) (<xref target="RFC2068" x:fmt="," x:sec="10.3.4"/>).
    As user agents did not change their behavior to maintain backwards
    compatibility, the first revision of HTTP/1.1 added yet another status code,
    307 (Temporary Redirect), for which the backwards compatibility problems did
    not apply (<xref target="RFC2616" x:fmt="," x:sec="10.3.8"/>).
    Over 10 years later, most user agents still do method rewriting for
    status codes 301 and 302, therefore this specification makes that behavior
    conformant in case the original request was POST.
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   A Location header field on a 3xx response indicates that a client &MAY;
   automatically redirect to the URI provided; see <xref target="header.location"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Note that for methods not known to be "safe", as defined in <xref target="safe.methods"/>,
   automatic redirection needs to done with care, since the redirect might
   change the conditions under which the request was issued.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD; detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e.,
   "infinite" redirection loops).
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> An earlier version of this specification recommended a
    maximum of five redirections (<xref target="RFC2068" x:fmt="," x:sec="10.3"/>).
    Content developers need to be aware that some clients might
    implement such a fixed limitation.

<t>
   The 303 status code indicates that the server is redirecting the
   user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the
   Location header field, that is intended to provide an indirect
   response to the original request.  In order to satisfy the original
   request, a user agent &SHOULD; perform a retrieval request using the
   Location URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which
   may itself be redirected further, and present the eventual result as an
   answer to the original request.
   Note that the new URI in the Location header field is not considered
   equivalent to the effective request URI. 
</t>
<t>
   This status code is generally applicable to any HTTP method.  It is
   primarily used to allow the output of a POST action to redirect
   the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the
   information corresponding to the POST response in a form that
   can be separately identified, bookmarked, and cached independent
   of the original request.
</t>
<t>
   A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the requested
   resource does not have a representation of its own that can be
   transferred by the server over HTTP.  The Location URI indicates a
   resource that is descriptive of the target resource, such that the
   follow-on representation might be useful to recipients without
   implying that it adequately represents the target resource.
   Note that answers to the questions of what can be represented, what
   representations are adequate, and what might be a useful description
   are outside the scope of HTTP and thus entirely determined by the
   URI owner(s).
</t>
<t>
   Except for responses to a HEAD request, the representation of a 303 
   response &SHOULD; contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink 
   to the Location URI.

   The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current

   it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict

   Ideally, the response representation would include enough information for the
   user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be

   Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
   example, if versioning were being used and the representation being PUT
   included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
   earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
   to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the

   The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web

<t>
   Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in
   which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
   performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
   server &SHOULD; include a representation containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
   condition. User agents &SHOULD; display any included representation to the
   user. These response codes are applicable to any request method.

<t>
   HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
   for date/time stamps. However, the preferred format is a fixed-length subset
   of that defined by <xref target="RFC1123"/>:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example" x:indent-with="  ">
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 1123

Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse a date value &MUST; accept
   all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they &MUST;
   only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
   in header fields.
</t>
<t>
   All HTTP date/time stamps &MUST; be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
   (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
   equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
   first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
   abbreviation for time zone, and &MUST; be assumed when reading the
   asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and &MUST-NOT; include
   additional whitespace beyond that specifically included as SP in the
   grammar.

<section title="Product Tokens" anchor="product.tokens">
  <x:anchor-alias value="product"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="product-version"/>
<t>
   Product tokens are used to allow communicating applications to
   identify themselves by software name and version. Most fields using
   product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part
   of the application to be listed, separated by whitespace. By
   convention, the products are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="product"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="product-version"/>

<figure><artwork type="example">
  User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3
  Server: Apache/0.8.4
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Product tokens &SHOULD; be short and to the point. They &MUST-NOT; be
   used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any
   token octet &MAY; appear in a product-version, this token &SHOULD;
   only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of
   the same product &SHOULD; only differ in the product-version portion of
   the product value).
</t>

<section title="Character Encodings (charset)" anchor="character.sets">
<t>
   HTTP uses charset names to indicate the character encoding of a
   textual representation.
</t>
<t anchor="rule.charset">
  <x:anchor-alias value="charset"/>
   A character encoding is identified by a case-insensitive token. The
   complete set of tokens is defined by the IANA Character Set registry
   (<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets"/>).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="charset"/>
  <x:ref>charset</x:ref> = <x:ref>token</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Although HTTP allows an arbitrary token to be used as a charset
   value, any token that has a predefined value within the IANA
   Character Set registry &MUST; represent the character encoding defined
   by that registry. Applications &SHOULD; limit their use of character
   encodings to those defined within the IANA registry.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP uses charset in two contexts: within an Accept-Charset request
   header field (in which the charset value is an unquoted token) and as the
   value of a parameter in a Content-Type header field (within a request or
   response), in which case the parameter value of the charset parameter
   can be quoted.

<section title="Content Codings" anchor="content.codings">
  <x:anchor-alias value="content-coding"/>
<t>
   Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has
   been or can be applied to a representation. Content codings are primarily
   used to allow a representation to be compressed or otherwise usefully
   transformed without losing the identity of its underlying media type
   and without loss of information. Frequently, the representation is stored in
   coded form, transmitted directly, and only decoded by the recipient.
</t>

   All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding (<xref target="header.accept-encoding"/>) and
   Content-Encoding (<xref target="header.content-encoding"/>) header fields. Although the value
   describes the content-coding, what is more important is that it

<t>
   The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case-insensitive.
   Parameter values might or might not be case-sensitive, depending on the
   semantics of the parameter name.  The presence or absence of a parameter might
   be significant to the processing of a media-type, depending on its
   definition within the media type registry.
</t>
<t>
   A parameter value that matches the <x:ref>token</x:ref> production can be
   transmitted as either a token or within a quoted-string. The quoted and
   unquoted values are equivalent. 
</t>
<t>
   Note that some older HTTP applications do not recognize media type
   parameters. When sending data to older HTTP applications,
   implementations &SHOULD; only use media type parameters when they are
   required by that type/subtype definition.
</t>
<t>
   Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number
   Authority (IANA). The media type registration process is
   outlined in <xref target="RFC4288"/>. Use of non-registered media types is
   discouraged.
</t>

<section title="Canonicalization and Text Defaults" anchor="canonicalization.and.text.defaults">
<t>
   Internet media types are registered with a canonical form. A
   representation transferred via HTTP messages &MUST; be in the
   appropriate canonical form prior to its transmission except for
   "text" types, as defined in the next paragraph.
</t>
<t>
   When in canonical form, media subtypes of the "text" type use CRLF as
   the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the
   transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line
   break when it is done consistently for an entire representation. HTTP
   applications &MUST; accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as indicating
   a line break in text media received via HTTP. In
   addition, if the text is in a character encoding that does not
   use octets 13 and 10 for CR and LF respectively, as is the case for
   some multi-byte character encodings, HTTP allows the use of whatever octet
   sequences are defined by that character encoding to represent the
   equivalent of CR and LF for line breaks. This flexibility regarding
   line breaks applies only to text media in the payload body; a bare CR
   or LF &MUST-NOT; be substituted for CRLF within any of the HTTP control
   structures (such as header fields and multipart boundaries).

   If a representation is encoded with a content-coding, the underlying
   data &MUST; be in a form defined above prior to being encoded.

<section title="Multipart Types" anchor="multipart.types">
<t>
   MIME provides for a number of "multipart" types &mdash; encapsulations of
   one or more representations within a single message body. All multipart
   types share a common syntax, as defined in <xref target="RFC2046" x:sec="5.1.1" x:fmt="of"/>,
   and &MUST; include a boundary parameter as part of the media type
   value. The message body is itself a protocol element and &MUST;
   therefore use only CRLF to represent line breaks between body-parts.
</t>
<t>
   In general, HTTP treats a multipart message body no differently than
   any other media type: strictly as payload.  HTTP does not use the
   multipart boundary as an indicator of message body length.
   <!-- jre: re-insert removed text pointing to caching? -->
   In all other respects, an HTTP user agent &SHOULD; follow the same or similar
   behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.
   The MIME header fields within each body-part of a multipart message body
   do not have any significance to HTTP beyond that defined by
   their MIME semantics.
</t>
<t>
   If an application receives an unrecognized multipart subtype, the
   application &MUST; treat it as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed".

   A language tag, as defined in <xref target="RFC5646"/>, identifies a

   communication of information to other human beings. Computer languages are
   explicitly excluded. HTTP uses language tags within the Accept-Language and
   Content-Language fields.
</t>
<t>
   In summary, a language tag is composed of one or more parts: A primary
   language subtag followed by a possibly empty series of subtags:

<section title="Payload" anchor="payload">
<t>
   HTTP messages &MAY; transfer a payload if not otherwise restricted by
   the request method or response status code.  The payload consists of
   metadata, in the form of header fields, and data, in the form of the
   sequence of octets in the message body after any transfer-coding has
   been decoded.
</t>
<iref item="payload"/>
<t>   
   A "<x:dfn>payload</x:dfn>" in HTTP is always a partial or complete
   representation of some resource.  We use separate terms for payload
   and representation because some messages contain only the associated
   representation's header fields (e.g., responses to HEAD) or only some
   part(s) of the representation (e.g., the 206 status code).
</t>
<section title="Payload Header Fields" anchor="payload.header.fields">
  <x:anchor-alias value="payload-header"/>
<t>
   HTTP header fields that specifically define the payload, rather than the
   associated representation, are referred to as "payload header fields".
   The following payload header fields are defined by HTTP/1.1:
</t>
<texttable align="left">
  <ttcol>Header Field Name</ttcol>

<section title="Payload Body" anchor="payload.body">
  <x:anchor-alias value="payload-body"/>
<t>
   A payload body is only present in a message when a message body is
   present, as described in &message-body;. The payload body is obtained
   from the message body by decoding any Transfer-Encoding that might
   have been applied to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Representation" anchor="representation">
<iref item="representation"/>
<t>
   A "<x:dfn>representation</x:dfn>" is information in a format that can be readily
   communicated from one party to another.  A resource representation
   is information that reflects the state of that resource, as observed
   at some point in the past (e.g., in a response to GET) or to be
   desired at some point in the future (e.g., in a PUT request).
</t>
<t>
   Most, but not all, representations transferred via HTTP are intended
   to be a representation of the target resource (the resource identified
   by the effective request URI).  The precise semantics of a representation
   are determined by the type of message (request or response), the request
   method, the response status code, and the representation metadata.
   For example, the above semantic is true for the representation in any
   200 (OK) response to GET and for the representation in any PUT request.
   A 200 response to PUT, in contrast, contains either a representation
   that describes the successful action or a representation of the target
   resource, with the latter indicated by a Content-Location header field
   with the same value as the effective request URI.  Likewise, response
   messages with an error status code usually contain a representation that
   describes the error and what next steps are suggested for resolving it.
</t>
<t>
   Request and Response messages &MAY; transfer a representation if not otherwise
   restricted by the request method or response status code. A representation
   consists of metadata (representation header fields) and data (representation
   body).  When a complete or partial representation is enclosed in an HTTP message,
   it is referred to as the payload of the message.
   <cref>#351</cref>
</t>
<t>
   A representation body is only present in a message when a message body is
   present, as described in &message-body;. The representation body is obtained
   from the message body by decoding any Transfer-Encoding that might
   have been applied to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message.

<section title="Identifying the Resource Associated with a Representation" anchor="identifying.response.associated.with.representation">
<t>
   It is sometimes necessary to determine an identifier for the resource
   associated with a representation.
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP request representation, when present, is always associated with an
   anonymous (i.e., unidentified) resource.
</t>
<t>
   In the common case, an HTTP response is a representation of the target
   resource (see &effective-request-uri;). However, this is not always the
   case. To determine the URI of the resource a response is associated with,
   the following rules are used (with the first applicable one being selected):
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
   <t>If the response status code is 200 or 203 and the request method was GET,
   the response payload is a representation of the target resource.</t>
   <t>If the response status code is 204, 206, or 304 and the request method was GET
   or HEAD, the response payload is a partial representation of the target
   resource.</t>
   <t>If the response has a Content-Location header field, and that URI is the same
   as the effective request URI, the response payload is a representation of the
   target resource.</t>
   <t>If the response has a Content-Location header field, and that URI is not the
   same as the effective request URI, then the response asserts that its
   payload is a representation of the resource identified by the
   Content-Location URI. However, such an assertion cannot be trusted unless
   it can be verified by other means (not defined by HTTP).</t>
   <t>Otherwise, the response is a representation of an anonymous (i.e.,
   unidentified) resource.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Representation Header Fields" anchor="representation.header.fields">
  <x:anchor-alias value="representation-header"/>
<t>
   Representation header fields define metadata about the representation data
   enclosed in the message body or, if no message body is present, about
   the representation that would have been transferred in a 200 response
   to a simultaneous GET request with the same effective request URI.
</t>
<t>
   The following header fields are defined as representation metadata:
</t>
<texttable align="left">
  <ttcol>Header Field Name</ttcol>
  <ttcol>Defined in...</ttcol>

  <c>Content-Encoding</c> <c><xref target="header.content-encoding"/></c>

  <c>Expires</c> <c>&header-expires;</c>
</texttable>
<t>
   Additional header fields define metadata about the selected
   representation, which might differ from the representation included
   in the message for responses to some state-changing methods.
   The following header fields are defined as selected representation
   metadata:
</t>
<texttable align="left">

</section>

<section title="Representation Data" anchor="representation.data">
  <x:anchor-alias value="representation-data"/>
<t>
   The representation body associated with an HTTP message is
   either provided as the payload body of the message or
   referred to by the message semantics and the effective request
   URI.  The representation data is in a format and encoding defined by
   the representation metadata header fields.
</t>
<t>
   The data type of the representation data
   is determined via the header fields Content-Type and Content-Encoding.
   These define a two-layer, ordered encoding model:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  representation-data := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( bits ) )
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Content-Type specifies the media type of the underlying data, which
   defines both the data format and how that data &SHOULD; be processed
   by the recipient (within the scope of the request method semantics).
   Any HTTP/1.1 message containing a payload body &SHOULD; include a
   Content-Type header field defining the media type of the associated
   representation unless that metadata is unknown to the sender.
   If the Content-Type header field is not present, it indicates that
   the sender does not know the media type of the representation;
   recipients &MAY; either assume that the media type is
   "application/octet-stream" (<xref target="RFC2046" x:fmt="," x:sec="4.5.1"/>)
   or examine the content to determine its type.
</t>
<t>
   In practice, resource owners do not always properly configure their origin
   server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given representation,
   with the result that some clients will examine a response body's content
   and override the specified type.
   Clients that do so risk drawing incorrect conclusions, which might expose
   additional security risks (e.g., "privilege escalation").  Furthermore,
   it is impossible to determine the sender's intent by examining the data
   format: many data formats match multiple media types that differ only in
   processing semantics.  Implementers are encouraged to provide a means of
   disabling such "content sniffing" when it is used.
</t>
<t>
   Content-Encoding is used to indicate any additional content
   codings applied to the data, usually for the purpose of data
   compression, that are a property of the representation.  If
   Content-Encoding is not present, then there is no additional
   encoding beyond that defined by the Content-Type.
</t>
</section>
</section>



<section title="Content Negotiation" anchor="content.negotiation">
<t>
   HTTP responses include a representation which contains information for
   interpretation, whether by a human user or for further processing.
   Often, the server has different ways of representing the
   same information; for example, in different formats, languages,
   or using different character encodings.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP clients and their users might have different or variable
   capabilities, characteristics or preferences which would influence
   which representation, among those available from the server,
   would be best for the server to deliver. For this reason, HTTP
   provides mechanisms for "content negotiation" &mdash; a process of
   allowing selection of a representation of a given resource,
   when more than one is available.
</t>
<t>
   This specification defines two patterns of content negotiation;
   "server-driven", where the server selects the representation based
   upon the client's stated preferences, and "agent-driven" negotiation,
   where the server provides a list of representations for the client to
   choose from, based upon their metadata. In addition,  there are
   other patterns: some applications use an "active content" pattern,
   where the server returns active content which runs on the client
   and, based on client available parameters, selects additional
   resources to invoke. "Transparent Content Negotiation" (<xref target="RFC2295"/>)
   has also been proposed.
</t>
<t>
   These patterns are all widely used, and have trade-offs in applicability
   and practicality. In particular, when the number of preferences or
   capabilities to be expressed by a client are large (such as when many
   different formats are supported by a user-agent), server-driven
   negotiation becomes unwieldy, and might not be appropriate. Conversely,
   when the number of representations to choose from is very large,
   agent-driven negotiation might not be appropriate.
</t>
<t>
   Note that in all cases, the supplier of representations has the
   responsibility for determining which representations might be
   considered to be the "same information".
</t>

<section title="Server-driven Negotiation" anchor="server-driven.negotiation">
<t>
   If the selection of the best representation for a response is made by
   an algorithm located at the server, it is called server-driven
   negotiation. Selection is based on the available representations of
   the response (the dimensions over which it can vary; e.g., language,
   content-coding, etc.) and the contents of particular header fields in
   the request message or on other information pertaining to the request
   (such as the network address of the client).
</t>
<t>
   Server-driven negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for
   selecting from among the available representations is difficult to
   describe to the user agent, or when the server desires to send its
   "best guess" to the client along with the first response (hoping to
   avoid the round-trip delay of a subsequent request if the "best
   guess" is good enough for the user). In order to improve the server's
   guess, the user agent &MAY; include request header fields (Accept,
   Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.) which describe its
   preferences for such a response.
</t>
<t>
   Server-driven negotiation has disadvantages:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>
         It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what
         might be "best" for any given user, since that would require
         complete knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent
         and the intended use for the response (e.g., does the user want
         to view it on screen or print it on paper?).
    </t>
    <t>
         Having the user agent describe its capabilities in every
         request can be both very inefficient (given that only a small
         percentage of responses have multiple representations) and a
         potential violation of the user's privacy.
    </t>
    <t>
         It complicates the implementation of an origin server and the
         algorithms for generating responses to a request.
    </t>
    <t>
         It might limit a public cache's ability to use the same response
         for multiple user's requests.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Server-driven negotiation allows the user agent to specify its preferences,
   but it cannot expect responses to always honor them. For example, the origin
   server might not implement server-driven negotiation, or it might decide that
   sending a response that doesn't conform to them is better than sending a 406
   (Not Acceptable) response.
</t>
<t>
   Many of the mechanisms for expressing preferences use quality values to
   declare relative preference. See &qvalue; for more information. 
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 includes the following header fields for enabling
   server-driven negotiation through description of user agent
   capabilities and user preferences: Accept (<xref target="header.accept"/>), Accept-Charset
   (<xref target="header.accept-charset"/>), Accept-Encoding (<xref target="header.accept-encoding"/>), Accept-Language
   (<xref target="header.accept-language"/>), and User-Agent (&header-user-agent;).
   However, an origin server is not limited to these dimensions and &MAY; vary 
   the response based on any aspect of the request, including aspects
   of the connection (e.g., IP address) or information within extension
   header fields not defined by this specification.
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> In practice, User-Agent based negotiation is fragile,
    because new clients might not be recognized. 
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   The Vary header field (&header-vary;) can be used to express the parameters the
   server uses to select a representation that is subject to server-driven
   negotiation.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Agent-driven Negotiation" anchor="agent-driven.negotiation">
<t>
   With agent-driven negotiation, selection of the best representation
   for a response is performed by the user agent after receiving an
   initial response from the origin server. Selection is based on a list
   of the available representations of the response included within the
   header fields or body of the initial response, with each
   representation identified by its own URI. Selection from among the
   representations can be performed automatically (if the user agent is
   capable of doing so) or manually by the user selecting from a
   generated (possibly hypertext) menu.
</t>
<t>
   Agent-driven negotiation is advantageous when the response would vary
   over commonly-used dimensions (such as type, language, or encoding),
   when the origin server is unable to determine a user agent's
   capabilities from examining the request, and generally when public
   caches are used to distribute server load and reduce network usage.
</t>
<t>
   Agent-driven negotiation suffers from the disadvantage of needing a
   second request to obtain the best alternate representation. This
   second request is only efficient when caching is used. In addition,
   this specification does not define any mechanism for supporting
   automatic selection, though it also does not prevent any such
   mechanism from being developed as an extension and used within
   HTTP/1.1.
</t>
<t>
   This specification defines the 300 (Multiple Choices) and 406 (Not Acceptable)
   status codes for enabling agent-driven negotiation when the server is
   unwilling or unable to provide a varying response using server-driven
   negotiation.

<section title="Header Field Definitions" anchor="header.field.definitions">

   The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify
   response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to
   indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired
   types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Accept"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="media-range"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="accept-params"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="accept-ext"/>

                   ) *( <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> ";" <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> <x:ref>parameter</x:ref> )
  <x:ref>accept-params</x:ref>  = <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> ";" <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> "q=" <x:ref>qvalue</x:ref> *( <x:ref>accept-ext</x:ref> )

</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The asterisk "*" character is used to group media types into ranges,
   with "*/*" indicating all media types and "type/*" indicating all
   subtypes of that type. The media-range &MAY; include media type
   parameters that are applicable to that range.
</t>
<t>
   Each media-range &MAY; be followed by one or more accept-params,
   beginning with the "q" parameter for indicating a relative quality
   factor. The first "q" parameter (if any) separates the media-range
   parameter(s) from the accept-params. Quality factors allow the user
   or user agent to indicate the relative degree of preference for that
   media-range, using the qvalue scale from 0 to 1 (&qvalue;). The
   default value is q=1.
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> Use of the "q" parameter name to separate media type
    parameters from Accept extension parameters is due to historical
    practice. Although this prevents any media type parameter named
    "q" from being used with a media range, such an event is believed
    to be unlikely given the lack of any "q" parameters in the IANA
    media type registry and the rare usage of any media type
    parameters in Accept. Future media types are discouraged from
    registering any parameter named "q".
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   The example
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   &SHOULD; be interpreted as "I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio
   type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality".
</t>
<t>
   A request without any Accept header field implies that the user agent
   will accept any media type in response.
   If an Accept header field is present in a request and none of the
   available representations for the response have a media type that is
   listed as acceptable, the origin server &MAY; either
   honor the Accept header field by sending a 406 (Not Acceptable) response
   or disregard the Accept header field by treating the response as if
   it is not subject to content negotiation.
</t>
<t>
   A more elaborate example is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html,
          text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Verbally, this would be interpreted as "text/html and text/x-c are
   the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the
   text/x-dvi representation, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain
   representation".
</t>
<t>
   Media ranges can be overridden by more specific media ranges or
   specific media types. If more than one media range applies to a given
   type, the most specific reference has precedence. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept: text/*, text/plain, text/plain;format=flowed, */*
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   have the following precedence:
   <list style="numbers">
    <t>text/plain;format=flowed</t>
    <t>text/plain</t>
    <t>text/*</t>
    <t>*/*</t>
   </list>
</t>
<t>
   The media type quality factor associated with a given type is
   determined by finding the media range with the highest precedence
   which matches that type. For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7, text/html;level=1,
          text/html;level=2;q=0.4, */*;q=0.5
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   would cause the following values to be associated:
</t>
<texttable align="left">
  <ttcol>Media Type</ttcol><ttcol>Quality Value</ttcol>
  <c>text/html;level=1</c>    <c>1</c>
  <c>text/html</c>            <c>0.7</c>
  <c>text/plain</c>           <c>0.3</c>
  <c>image/jpeg</c>           <c>0.5</c>
  <c>text/html;level=2</c>    <c>0.4</c>
  <c>text/html;level=3</c>    <c>0.7</c>
</texttable>
<t>
      <x:h>Note:</x:h> A user agent might be provided with a default set of quality
      values for certain media ranges. However, unless the user agent is
      a closed system which cannot interact with other rendering agents,
      this default set ought to be configurable by the user.

<t>
   The "Accept-Charset" header field can be used by user agents to
   indicate what character encodings are acceptable in a response
   payload. This field allows
   clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose
   character encodings to signal that capability to a server which is capable of
   representing documents in those character encodings.
</t>

<t>
   Character encoding values (a.k.a., charsets) are described in
   <xref target="character.sets"/>. Each charset &MAY; be given an
   associated quality value which represents the user's preference
   for that charset. The default value is q=1. An example is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field,
   matches every character encoding which is not mentioned elsewhere in the
   Accept-Charset field. If no "*" is present in an Accept-Charset field, then
   all character encodings not explicitly mentioned get a quality value of 0.
</t>
<t>
   A request without any Accept-Charset header field implies that the user
   agent will accept any character encoding in response.
   If an Accept-Charset header field is present in a request and none of the
   available representations for the response have a character encoding that
   is listed as acceptable, the origin server &MAY; either honor the
   Accept-Charset header field by sending a 406 (Not Acceptable) response or
   disregard the Accept-Charset header field by treating the response as if
   it is not subject to content negotiation.

   The "Accept-Encoding" header field can be used by user agents to
   indicate what response content-codings (<xref target="content.codings"/>)
   are acceptable in the response.  An "identity" token is used as a synonym
   for "no encoding" in order to communicate when no encoding is preferred.

<t>
   Each codings value &MAY; be given an associated quality value which

</t>
<t>
   For example,
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
  Accept-Encoding:
  Accept-Encoding: *

  Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   A server tests whether a content-coding for a given representation is
   acceptable, according to an Accept-Encoding field, using these rules:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>The special "*" symbol in an Accept-Encoding field matches any
         available content-coding not explicitly listed in the header
         field.</t>

      <t>If the representation has no content-coding, then it is acceptable
         by default unless specifically excluded by the Accept-Encoding field
         stating either "identity;q=0" or "*;q=0" without a more specific
         entry for "identity".</t>

      <t>If the representation's content-coding is one of the content-codings
         listed in the Accept-Encoding field, then it is acceptable unless
         it is accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in &qvalue;, a
         qvalue of 0 means "not acceptable".)</t>

      <t>If multiple content-codings are acceptable, then the acceptable
         content-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is preferred.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   An Accept-Encoding header field with a combined field-value that is empty
   implies that the user agent does not want any content-coding in response.
   If an Accept-Encoding header field is present in a request and none of the
   available representations for the response have a content-coding that
   is listed as acceptable, the origin server &SHOULD; send a response
   without any content-coding.
</t>
<t>
   A request without an Accept-Encoding header field implies that the user
   agent will accept any content-coding in response, but a representation
   without content-coding is preferred for compatibility with the widest
   variety of user agents.
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> Most HTTP/1.0 applications do not recognize or obey qvalues
    associated with content-codings. This means that qvalues will not
    work and are not permitted with x-gzip or x-compress.

<t>
   For matching, <xref target="RFC4647" x:sec="3" x:fmt="of"/> defines

<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> The "Basic Filtering" scheme (<xref target="RFC4647"

</x:note>

   It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send
   an Accept-Language header field with the complete linguistic preferences of
   the user in every request. For a discussion of this issue, see
   <xref target="privacy.issues.connected.to.accept.header.fields"/>.
</t>
<t>
   As intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual user, it is
   recommended that client applications make the choice of linguistic
   preference available to the user. If the choice is not made
   available, then the Accept-Language header field &MUST-NOT; be given in
   the request.
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> When making the choice of linguistic preference available to
    the user, we remind implementors of  the fact that users are not
    familiar with the details of language matching as described above,
    and ought to be provided appropriate guidance. As an example, users
    might assume that on selecting "en-gb", they will be served any
    kind of English document if British English is not available. A
    user agent might suggest in such a case to add "en" to get the
    best matching behavior.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Content-Encoding"/>
<t>
   The "Content-Encoding" header field indicates what content-codings 
   have been applied to the representation beyond those inherent in the media
   type, and thus what decoding mechanisms have to be applied in order to obtain
   the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
   Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a representation to be
   compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Content-Encoding"/>
  <x:ref>Content-Encoding</x:ref> = 1#<x:ref>content-coding</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Content codings are defined in <xref target="content.codings"/>. An example of its use is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Content-Encoding: gzip
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The content-coding is a characteristic of the representation.
   Typically, the representation body is stored with this
   encoding and is only decoded before rendering or analogous usage.
   However, a transforming proxy &MAY; modify the content-coding if the
   new coding is known to be acceptable to the recipient, unless the
   "no-transform" cache-control directive is present in the message.
</t>
<t>
   If the media type includes an inherent encoding, such as a data format
   that is always compressed, then that encoding would not be restated as 
   a Content-Encoding even if it happens to be the same algorithm as one
   of the content-codings.  Such a content-coding would only be listed if,
   for some bizarre reason, it is applied a second time to form the
   representation.  Likewise, an origin server might choose to publish the
   same payload data as multiple representations that differ only in whether
   the coding is defined as part of Content-Type or Content-Encoding, since
   some user agents will behave differently in their handling of each
   response (e.g., open a "Save as ..." dialog instead of automatic
   decompression and rendering of content).
</t>
<t>
   A representation that has a content-coding applied to it &MUST; include
   a Content-Encoding header field (<xref target="header.content-encoding"/>)
   that lists the content-coding(s) applied.
</t>
<t>
   If multiple encodings have been applied to a representation, the content
   codings &MUST; be listed in the order in which they were applied.
   Additional information about the encoding parameters &MAY; be provided
   by other header fields not defined by this specification.
</t>
<t>
   If the content-coding of a representation in a request message is not
   acceptable to the origin server, the server &SHOULD; respond with a
   status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).
</t>

  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Content-Language" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Content-Language"/>
<t>
   The "Content-Language" header field describes the natural
   language(s) of the intended audience for the representation. Note that this might
   not be equivalent to all the languages used within the representation.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Content-Language"/>
  <x:ref>Content-Language</x:ref> = 1#<x:ref>language-tag</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Language tags are defined in <xref target="language.tags"/>. The primary purpose of
   Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate
   representations according to the user's own preferred language. Thus, if the
   body content is intended only for a Danish-literate audience, the
   appropriate field is
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Content-Language: da
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the content
   is intended for all language audiences. This might mean that the
   sender does not consider it to be specific to any natural language,
   or that the sender does not know for which language it is intended.
</t>
<t>
   Multiple languages &MAY; be listed for content that is intended for
   multiple audiences. For example, a rendition of the "Treaty of
   Waitangi", presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English
   versions, would call for
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Content-Language: mi, en
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   However, just because multiple languages are present within a representation
   does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences.
   An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as "A First
   Lesson in Latin", which is clearly intended to be used by an
   English-literate audience. In this case, the Content-Language would
   properly only include "en".
</t>
<t>
   Content-Language &MAY; be applied to any media type &mdash; it is not
   limited to textual documents.

  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Content-Location" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Content-Location"/>
<t>
   The "Content-Location" header field supplies a URI that can be used
   as a specific identifier for the representation in this message.
   In other words, if one were to perform a GET on this URI at the time
   of this message's generation, then a 200 response would contain the
   same representation that is enclosed as payload in this message.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Content-Location"/>
  <x:ref>Content-Location</x:ref> = <x:ref>absolute-URI</x:ref> / <x:ref>partial-URI</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the effective
   Request URI (&effective-request-uri;).  It is representation metadata.
   It has the same syntax and semantics as the header field of the same name
   defined for MIME body parts in <xref target="RFC2557" x:fmt="of" x:sec="4"/>.
   However, its appearance in an HTTP message has some special implications
   for HTTP recipients.
</t>
<t>
   If Content-Location is included in a response message and its value
   is the same as the effective request URI, then the response payload
   &SHOULD; be considered a current representation of that resource.
   For a GET or HEAD request, this is the same as the default semantics
   when no Content-Location is provided by the server.  For a state-changing
   request like PUT or POST, it implies that the server's response contains
   the new representation of that resource, thereby distinguishing it from
   representations that might only report about the action (e.g., "It worked!").
   This allows authoring applications to update their local copies without
   the need for a subsequent GET request.
</t>
<t>
   If Content-Location is included in a response message and its value
   differs from the effective request URI, then the origin server is
   informing recipients that this representation has its own, presumably
   more specific, identifier.  For a GET or HEAD request, this is an
   indication that the effective request URI identifies a resource that
   is subject to content negotiation and the selected representation for
   this response can also be found at the identified URI.  For other
   methods, such a Content-Location indicates that this representation
   contains a report on the action's status and the same report is
   available (for future access with GET) at the given URI.  For
   example, a purchase transaction made via a POST request might
   include a receipt document as the payload of the 200 response;
   the Content-Location value provides an identifier for retrieving
   a copy of that same receipt in the future.
</t>
<t>
   If Content-Location is included in a request message, then it &MAY;
   be interpreted by the origin server as an indication of where the
   user agent originally obtained the content of the enclosed
   representation (prior to any subsequent modification of the content
   by that user agent).  In other words, the user agent is providing
   the same representation metadata that it received with the original
   representation.  However, such interpretation &MUST-NOT; be used to
   alter the semantics of the method requested by the client.  For
   example, if a client makes a PUT request on a negotiated resource
   and the origin server accepts that PUT (without redirection), then the
   new set of values for that resource is expected to be consistent with
   the one representation supplied in that PUT; the Content-Location
   cannot be used as a form of reverse content selection that
   identifies only one of the negotiated representations to be updated.
   If the user agent had wanted the latter semantics, it would have applied
   the PUT directly to the Content-Location URI.
</t>
<t>
   A Content-Location field received in a request message is transitory
   information that &SHOULD-NOT; be saved with other representation
   metadata for use in later responses.  The Content-Location's value
   might be saved for use in other contexts, such as within source links
   or other metadata.
</t>
<t>
   A cache cannot assume that a representation with a Content-Location
   different from the URI used to retrieve it can be used to respond to
   later requests on that Content-Location URI.
</t>
<t>
   If the Content-Location value is a partial URI, the partial URI is
   interpreted relative to the effective request URI.

</t>
<t>
   The HTTP-date sent in a Date header field &SHOULD-NOT; represent a date and

   generation, unless the implementation has no means of generating a
   reasonably accurate date and time. In theory, the date ought to
   represent the moment just before the payload is generated. In

   The Expect mechanism is hop-by-hop: the above requirements apply to any
   server, including proxies. However, the Expect header field itself is
   end-to-end; it &MUST; be forwarded if the request is forwarded.
</t>
<t>
   Many older HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 applications do not understand the Expect
   header field.

<t>
   The "From" header field, if given, &SHOULD; contain an Internet
   e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user
   agent. The address &SHOULD; be machine-usable, as defined by "mailbox"
   in <xref x:sec="3.4" x:fmt="of" target="RFC5322"/>:

<t>
   An example is:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">

<t>
   This header field &MAY; be used for logging purposes and as a means for
   identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests. It &SHOULD-NOT; 
   be used as an insecure form of access protection. The interpretation
   of this field is that the request is being performed on behalf of the
   person given, who accepts responsibility for the method performed. In
   particular, robot agents &SHOULD; include this header field so that the
   person responsible for running the robot can be contacted if problems
   occur on the receiving end.
</t>
<t>
   The Internet e-mail address in this field &MAY; be separate from the
   Internet host which issued the request. For example, when a request
   is passed through a proxy the original issuer's address &SHOULD; be
   used.
</t>
<t>
   The client &SHOULD-NOT;  send the From header field without the user's
   approval, as it might conflict with the user's privacy interests or
   their site's security policy. It is strongly recommended that the
   user be able to disable, enable, and modify the value of this field
   at any time prior to a request.
</t>

<section title="Location" anchor="header.location">
  <iref primary="true" item="Location header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Location" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Location"/>
<t>
   The "Location" header field &MAY; be sent in responses to refer to
   a specific resource in accordance with the semantics of the status
   code.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Location"/>
  <x:ref>Location</x:ref> = <x:ref>URI-reference</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   For 201 (Created) responses, the Location is the URI of the new resource
   which was created by the request. For 3xx responses, the location &SHOULD;
   indicate the server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the
   resource.
</t>
<t>
   The field value consists of a single URI-reference. When it has the form
   of a relative reference (<xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="4.2"/>),
   the final value is computed by resolving it against the effective request
   URI (<xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="5"/>). If the original URI, as
   navigated to by the user agent, did contain a fragment identifier, and the
   final value does not, then the original URI's fragment identifier is added
   to the final value.
</t>
<figure>
<preamble>For example, the original URI "http://www.example.org/~tim", combined with a field value given as:</preamble><!--DO NOT DARE changing the vertical spacing below, it's necessary this way for xml2rfc-->
<artwork type="example">
  Location: /pub/WWW/People.html#tim
</artwork>
<postamble>would result in a final value of "http://www.example.org/pub/WWW/People.html#tim"</postamble>
</figure>
<figure>
<preamble>An original URI "http://www.example.org/index.html#larry", combined with a field value given as:</preamble><!--DO NOT DARE changing the vertical spacing below, it's necessary this way for xml2rfc-->
<artwork type="example">
  Location: http://www.example.net/index.html
</artwork>
<postamble>would result in a final value of "http://www.example.net/index.html#larry", preserving the original fragment identifier.</postamble>
</figure>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> Some recipients attempt to recover from Location fields
    that are not valid URI references. This specification does not mandate or
    define such processing, but does allow it (see <xref target="intro.conformance.and.error.handling"/>).
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   There are circumstances in which a fragment identifier in a Location URI
   would not be appropriate. For instance, when it appears in a 201 Created
   response, where the Location header field specifies the URI for the entire
   created resource.
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> The Content-Location header field (&header-content-location;) differs
    from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the most specific
    resource corresponding to the enclosed representation.
    It is therefore possible for a response to contain header fields for
    both Location and Content-Location.
  </t>

<section title="Max-Forwards" anchor="header.max-forwards">
  <iref primary="true" item="Max-Forwards header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Max-Forwards" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Max-Forwards"/>
<t>
   The "Max-Forwards" header field provides a mechanism with the
   TRACE (<xref target="TRACE"/>) and OPTIONS (<xref target="OPTIONS"/>)
   methods to limit the number of times that the request is forwarded by
   proxies. This can be useful when the client is attempting to
   trace a request which appears to be failing or looping mid-chain.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Max-Forwards"/>
  <x:ref>Max-Forwards</x:ref> = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining
   number of times this request message can be forwarded.
</t>
<t>
   Each recipient of a TRACE or OPTIONS request
   containing a Max-Forwards header field &MUST; check and update its
   value prior to forwarding the request. If the received value is zero
   (0), the recipient &MUST-NOT; forward the request; instead, it &MUST;
   respond as the final recipient. If the received Max-Forwards value is
   greater than zero, then the forwarded message &MUST; contain an updated
   Max-Forwards field with a value decremented by one (1).
</t>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards header field &MAY; be ignored for all other request
   methods.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Referer" anchor="header.referer">
  <iref primary="true" item="Referer header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Referer" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Referer"/>
<t>
   The "Referer" [sic] header field allows the client to specify the
   URI of the resource from which the target URI was obtained (the
   "referrer", although the header field is misspelled.).
</t>
<t>
   The Referer header field allows servers to generate lists of back-links to
   resources for interest, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows
   obsolete or mistyped links to be traced for maintenance. Some servers use
   Referer as a means of controlling where they allow links from (so-called
   "deep linking"), but legitimate requests do not always
   contain a Referer header field.
</t>
<t>
   If the target URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own
   URI (e.g., input from the user keyboard), the Referer field &MUST; either be
   sent with the value "about:blank", or not be sent at all. Note that this
   requirement does not apply to sources with non-HTTP URIs (e.g., FTP).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Referer"/>
  <x:ref>Referer</x:ref> = <x:ref>absolute-URI</x:ref> / <x:ref>partial-URI</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Example:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Referer: http://www.example.org/hypertext/Overview.html
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   If the field value is a relative URI, it &SHOULD; be interpreted
   relative to the effective request URI. The URI &MUST-NOT; include a fragment. See
   <xref target="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris"/> for security considerations.
</t>

<section title="Retry-After" anchor="header.retry-after">

  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Retry-After" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Retry-After"/>
<t>
   The header "Retry-After" field can be used with a 503 (Service
   Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to
   be unavailable to the requesting client. This field &MAY; also be used
   with any 3xx (Redirection) response to indicate the minimum time the
   user-agent is asked to wait before issuing the redirected request.
</t>
<t>
   The value of this field can be either an HTTP-date or an integer number
   of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the response.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Retry-After"/>
  <x:ref>Retry-After</x:ref> = <x:ref>HTTP-date</x:ref> / <x:ref>delta-seconds</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t anchor="rule.delta-seconds">
  <x:anchor-alias value="delta-seconds"/>
   Time spans are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in
   seconds.
</t>

<t>
   Two examples of its use are
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
  Retry-After: 120

<t>
   In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.

  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="Server" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Server"/>
<t>
   The "Server" header field contains information about the
   software used by the origin server to handle the request.
</t>
<t>
   The field can contain multiple
   product tokens (<xref target="product.tokens"/>) and
   comments (&header-fields;) identifying the server and any significant
   subproducts. The product tokens are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.
</t>

<t>
   Example:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy
   application &MUST-NOT; modify the Server header field. Instead, it
   &MUST; include a Via field (as described in &header-via;).
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> Revealing the specific software version of the server might
    allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks
    against software that is known to contain security holes. Server
    implementors are encouraged to make this field a configurable
    option.
  </t>

<section title="User-Agent" anchor="header.user-agent">
  <iref primary="true" item="User-Agent header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="User-Agent" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="User-Agent"/>
<t>
   The "User-Agent" header field contains information about the user
   agent originating the request. User agents &SHOULD; include this field with
   requests.
</t>
<t>
   Typically, it is used for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol
   violations, and tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent
   limitations.
</t>
<t>
   The field can contain multiple
   product tokens (<xref target="product.tokens"/>)
   and comments (&header-fields;) identifying the agent and its
   significant subproducts. By convention, the product tokens are listed in
   order of their significance for identifying the application.
</t>
<t>
   Because this field is usually sent on every request a user agent makes,
   implementations are encouraged not to include needlessly fine-grained
   detail, and to limit (or even prohibit) the addition of subproducts by third
   parties. Overly long and detailed User-Agent field values make requests
   larger and can also be used to identify ("fingerprint") the user against
   their wishes.
</t>
<t>
   Likewise, implementations are encouraged not to use the product tokens of
   other implementations in order to declare compatibility with them, as this
   circumvents the purpose of the field. Finally, they are encouraged not to
   use comments to identify products; doing so makes the field value more
   difficult to parse.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<t>
   This section is meant to inform application developers, information
   providers, and users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1 as
   described by this document. The discussion does not include
   definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make
   some suggestions for reducing security risks.
</t>

<section title="Transfer of Sensitive Information" anchor="security.sensitive">
<t>
   Like any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the
   content of the data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori
   method of determining the sensitivity of any particular piece of
   information within the context of any given request. Therefore,
   applications &SHOULD; supply as much control over this information as
   possible to the provider of that information. Four header fields are
   worth special mention in this context: Server, Via, Referer and From.
</t>
<t>
   Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the
   server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software
   that is known to contain security holes. Implementors &SHOULD; make the
   Server header field a configurable option.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall &SHOULD;
   take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information
   that identifies the hosts behind the firewall. In particular, they
   &SHOULD; remove, or replace with sanitized versions, any Via fields
   generated behind the firewall.
</t>
<t>
   The Referer header field allows reading patterns to be studied and reverse
   links drawn. Although it can be very useful, its power can be abused
   if user details are not separated from the information contained in
   the Referer. Even when the personal information has been removed, the
   Referer header field might indicate a private document's URI whose
   publication would be inappropriate.
</t>
<t>
   The information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's
   privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it
   &SHOULD-NOT;  be transmitted without the user being able to disable,
   enable, and modify the contents of the field. The user &MUST; be able
   to set the contents of this field within a user preference or
   application defaults configuration.
</t>
<t>
   We suggest, though do not require, that a convenient toggle interface
   be provided for the user to enable or disable the sending of From and
   Referer information.
</t>
<t>
   The User-Agent (<xref target="header.user-agent"/>) or Server (<xref
   target="header.server"/>) header fields can sometimes be used to determine
   that a specific client or server has a particular security hole which might
   be exploited. Unfortunately, this same information is often used for other
   valuable purposes for which HTTP currently has no better mechanism.
</t>
<t>
   Furthermore, the User-Agent header field may contain enough entropy to be
   used, possibly in conjunction with other material, to uniquely identify the
   user.
</t>
<t>
   Some request methods, like TRACE (<xref target="TRACE"/>), expose information
   that was sent in request header fields within the body of their response. 
   Clients &SHOULD; be careful with sensitive information, like Cookies, 
   Authorization credentials, and other header fields that might be used to 
   collect data from the client.
</t> 
</section>

<section title="Encoding Sensitive Information in URIs" anchor="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris">
<t>
   Because the source of a link might be private information or might
   reveal an otherwise private information source, it is strongly
   recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the
   Referer field is sent. For example, a browser client could have a
   toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would
   respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From
   information.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD-NOT; include a Referer header field in a (non-secure)
   HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure
   protocol.
</t>
<t>
   Authors of services &SHOULD-NOT; use GET-based forms for the submission of
   sensitive data because that data will be placed in the request-target. Many
   existing servers, proxies, and user agents log or display the request-target
   in places where it might be visible to third parties. Such services can
   use POST-based form submission instead.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Location Header Fields: Spoofing and Information Leakage" anchor="location.spoofing-leakage">
<t>
   If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust
   one another, then it &MUST; check the values of Location and Content-Location
   header fields in responses that are generated under control of
   said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to
   invalidate resources over which they have no authority.
</t>
<t>
   Furthermore, appending the fragment identifier from one URI to another
   one obtained from a Location header field might leak confidential
   information to the target server &mdash; although the fragment identifier is
   not transmitted in the final request, it might be visible to the user agent
   through other means, such as scripting.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations for CONNECT">
<t>
   Since tunneled data is opaque to the proxy, there are additional 
   risks to tunneling to other well-known or reserved ports. 
   A HTTP client CONNECTing to port 25 could relay spam
   via SMTP, for example. As such, proxies &SHOULD; restrict CONNECT 
   access to a small number of known ports.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Header Fields" anchor="privacy.issues.connected.to.accept.header.fields">
<t>
   Accept header fields can reveal information about the user to all
   servers which are accessed. The Accept-Language header field in particular
   can reveal information the user would consider to be of a private
   nature, because the understanding of particular languages is often
   strongly correlated to the membership of a particular ethnic group.
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header field to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.
</t>
<t>
   An approach that limits the loss of privacy would be for a user agent
   to omit the sending of Accept-Language header fields by default, and to ask
   the user whether or not to start sending Accept-Language header fields to a
   server if it detects, by looking for any Vary header fields
   generated by the server, that such sending could improve the quality
   of service.
</t>
<t>
   Elaborate user-customized accept header fields sent in every request,
   in particular if these include quality values, can be used by servers
   as relatively reliable and long-lived user identifiers. Such user
   identifiers would allow content providers to do click-trail tracking,
   and would allow collaborating content providers to match cross-server
   click-trails or form submissions of individual users. Note that for
   many users not behind a proxy, the network address of the host
   running the user agent will also serve as a long-lived user
   identifier. In environments where proxies are used to enhance
   privacy, user agents ought to be conservative in offering accept
   header configuration options to end users. As an extreme privacy
   measure, proxies could filter the accept header fields in relayed requests.
   General purpose user agents which provide a high degree of header
   configurability &SHOULD; warn users about the loss of privacy which can
   be involved.

<section title="Differences between HTTP and MIME" anchor="differences.between.http.and.mime">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 uses many of the constructs defined for Internet Mail (<xref target="RFC5322"/>) and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME <xref target="RFC2045"/>) to
   allow a message body to be transmitted in an open variety of
   representations and with extensible mechanisms. However, RFC 2045
   discusses mail, and HTTP has a few features that are different from
   those described in MIME. These differences were carefully chosen
   to optimize performance over binary connections, to allow greater
   freedom in the use of new media types, to make date comparisons
   easier, and to acknowledge the practice of some early HTTP servers
   and clients.
</t>
<t>
   This appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from MIME.
   Proxies and gateways to strict MIME environments &SHOULD; be
   aware of these differences and provide the appropriate conversions
   where necessary. Proxies and gateways from MIME environments to HTTP
   also need to be aware of the differences because some conversions
   might be required.
</t>

<section title="MIME-Version" anchor="mime-version">
  <iref primary="true" item="MIME-Version header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Header Fields" subitem="MIME-Version" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="MIME-Version"/>
<t>
   HTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. However, HTTP/1.1 messages &MAY;
   include a single MIME-Version header field to indicate what
   version of the MIME protocol was used to construct the message. Use
   of the MIME-Version header field indicates that the message is in
   full conformance with the MIME protocol (as defined in <xref target="RFC2045"/>).
   Proxies/gateways are responsible for ensuring full conformance (where
   possible) when exporting HTTP messages to strict MIME environments.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="MIME-Version"/>
  <x:ref>MIME-Version</x:ref> = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref> "." 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   MIME version "1.0" is the default for use in HTTP/1.1. However,
   HTTP/1.1 message parsing and semantics are defined by this document
   and not the MIME specification.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conversion to Canonical Form" anchor="conversion.to.canonical.form">
<t>
   MIME requires that an Internet mail body-part be converted to
   canonical form prior to being transferred, as described in <xref target="RFC2049" x:fmt="of" x:sec="4"/>.
   <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/> of this document describes the forms
   allowed for subtypes of the "text" media type when transmitted over
   HTTP. <xref target="RFC2046"/> requires that content with a type of "text" represent
   line breaks as CRLF and forbids the use of CR or LF outside of line
   break sequences. HTTP allows CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF to indicate a
   line break within text content when a message is transmitted over
   HTTP.
</t>
<t>
   Where it is possible, a proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict MIME
   environment &SHOULD; translate all line breaks within the text media
   types described in <xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/>
   of this document to the RFC 2049
   canonical form of CRLF. Note, however, that this might be complicated
   by the presence of a Content-Encoding and by the fact that HTTP
   allows the use of some character encodings which do not use octets 13 and
   10 to represent CR and LF, respectively, as is the case for some multi-byte
   character encodings.
</t>
<t>
   Conversion will break any cryptographic
   checksums applied to the original content unless the original content
   is already in canonical form. Therefore, the canonical form is
   recommended for any content that uses such checksums in HTTP.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Conversion of Date Formats" anchor="conversion.of.date.formats">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 uses a restricted set of date formats (&http-date;) to
   simplify the process of date comparison. Proxies and gateways from
   other protocols &SHOULD; ensure that any Date header field present in a
   message conforms to one of the HTTP/1.1 formats and rewrite the date
   if necessary.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Introduction of Content-Encoding" anchor="introduction.of.content-encoding">
<t>
   MIME does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP/1.1's
   Content-Encoding header field. Since this acts as a modifier on the
   media type, proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant
   protocols &MUST; either change the value of the Content-Type header
   field or decode the representation before forwarding the message. (Some
   experimental applications of Content-Type for Internet mail have used
   a media-type parameter of ";conversions=&lt;content-coding&gt;" to perform
   a function equivalent to Content-Encoding. However, this parameter is
   not part of the MIME standards).
</t>
</section>

<section title="No Content-Transfer-Encoding" anchor="no.content-transfer-encoding">
  <iref item="Content-Transfer-Encoding header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref item="Header Fields" subitem="Content-Transfer-Encoding" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   HTTP does not use the Content-Transfer-Encoding field of MIME.
   Proxies and gateways from MIME-compliant protocols to HTTP &MUST;
   remove any Content-Transfer-Encoding
   prior to delivering the response message to an HTTP client.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols are
   responsible for ensuring that the message is in the correct format
   and encoding for safe transport on that protocol, where "safe
   transport" is defined by the limitations of the protocol being used.
   Such a proxy or gateway &SHOULD; label the data with an appropriate
   Content-Transfer-Encoding if doing so will improve the likelihood of
   safe transport over the destination protocol.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Introduction of Transfer-Encoding" anchor="introduction.of.transfer-encoding">
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 introduces the Transfer-Encoding header field (&header-transfer-encoding;).
   Proxies/gateways &MUST; remove any transfer-coding prior to
   forwarding a message via a MIME-compliant protocol.
</t>
</section>

<section title="MHTML and Line Length Limitations" anchor="mhtml.line.length">
<t>
   HTTP implementations which share code with MHTML <xref target="RFC2557"/> implementations
   need to be aware of MIME line length limitations. Since HTTP does not
   have this limitation, HTTP does not fold long lines. MHTML messages
   being transported by HTTP follow all conventions of MHTML, including
   line length limitations and folding, canonicalization, etc., since
   HTTP transports all message-bodies as payload (see <xref target="multipart.types"/>) and
   does not interpret the content or any MIME header lines that might be
   contained therein.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Additional Features" anchor="additional.features">
<t>
   <xref target="RFC1945"/> and <xref target="RFC2068"/> document protocol elements used by some
   existing HTTP implementations, but not consistently and correctly
   across most HTTP/1.1 applications. Implementors are advised to be
   aware of these features, but cannot rely upon their presence in, or
   interoperability with, other HTTP/1.1 applications. Some of these
   describe proposed experimental features, and some describe features
   that experimental deployment found lacking that are now addressed in
   the base HTTP/1.1 specification.
</t>
<t>
   A number of other header fields, such as Content-Disposition and Title,
   from SMTP and MIME are also often implemented (see <xref target="RFC6266"/>
   and <xref target="RFC2076"/>).
</t>

  for status codes 301 and 302.
  (Sections <xref format="counter" target="status.301"/>,
  <xref format="counter" target="status.302"/> and
  <xref format="counter" target="status.307"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Deprecate 305 Use Proxy status code, because user agents did not implement it.
  It used to indicate that the target resource needs to be accessed through the
  proxy given by the Location field. The Location field gave the URI of the
  proxy. The recipient was expected to repeat this single request via the proxy.
  (<xref target="status.305"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Define status 426 (Upgrade Required) (this was incorporated from
  <xref target="RFC2817"/>).
  (<xref target="status.426"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Change ABNF productions for header fields to only define the field value.
  (<xref target="header.field.definitions"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Reclassify "Allow" as response header field, removing the option to
  specify it in a PUT request.
  Relax the server requirement on the contents of the Allow header field and
  remove requirement on clients to always trust the header field value.
  (<xref target="header.allow"/>)
</t>
<t>
  The ABNF for the Expect header field has been both fixed (allowing parameters
  for value-less expectations as well) and simplified (allowing trailing
  semicolons after "100-continue" when they were invalid before).
  (<xref target="header.expect"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Correct syntax of Location header field to allow URI references (including
  relative references and fragments), as referred symbol "absoluteURI" wasn't
  what was expected, and add some clarifications as to when use of fragments 
  would not be appropriate.
  (<xref target="header.location"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Restrict Max-Forwards header field to OPTIONS and TRACE (previously,
  extension methods could have used it as well).
  (<xref target="header.max-forwards"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Allow Referer field value of "about:blank" as alternative to not specifying it. 
  (<xref target="header.referer"/>)
</t>
<t>
  In the description of the Server header field, the Via field
  was described as a SHOULD. The requirement was and is stated
  correctly in the description of the Via header field in &header-via;.
  (<xref target="header.server"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Clarify contexts that charset is used in.
  (<xref target="character.sets"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Registration of Content Codings now requires IETF Review
  (<xref target="content.coding.registry"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove the default character encoding of "ISO-8859-1" for text media types; the
  default now is whatever the media type definition says.
  (<xref target="canonicalization.and.text.defaults"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Change ABNF productions for header fields to only define the field value.
  (<xref target="header.field.definitions"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove definition of Content-MD5 header field because it was inconsistently
  implemented with respect to partial responses, and also because of known
  deficiencies in the hash algorithm itself (see <xref target="RFC6151"/> for details).
  (<xref target="header.field.definitions"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove ISO-8859-1 special-casing in Accept-Charset.
  (<xref target="header.accept-charset"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove base URI setting semantics for Content-Location due to poor
  implementation support, which was caused by too many broken servers emitting
  bogus Content-Location header fields, and also the potentially undesirable effect
  of potentially breaking relative links in content-negotiated resources.
  (<xref target="header.content-location"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove reference to non-existant identity transfer-coding value tokens.
  (<xref target="no.content-transfer-encoding"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Remove discussion of Content-Disposition header field, it is now defined
  by <xref target="RFC6266"/>.
  (<xref target="additional.features"/>)
</t>
