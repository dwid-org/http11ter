<abstract>
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This document is Part 2 of the seven-part specification
   that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together,
   obsoletes RFC 2616.  Part 2 defines the semantics of HTTP messages
   as expressed by request methods, request-header fields, response status codes,
   and response-header fields.
</t>
</abstract>

<note title="Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)">
  <t>
    Discussion of this draft should take place on the HTTPBIS working group
    mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org). The current issues list is
    at <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/report/11"/>
    and related documents (including fancy diffs) can be found at
    <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/"/>.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
   This document defines HTTP/1.1 request and response semantics.  Each HTTP
   message, as defined in &messaging;, is in the form of either a request or
   a response.  An HTTP server listens on a connection for HTTP requests and
   responds to each request, in the order received on that connection, with
   one or more HTTP response messages.  This document defines the commonly
   agreed upon semantics of the HTTP uniform interface, the intentions defined
   by each request method, and the various response messages that might be
   expected as a result of applying that method for the requested resource.
</t>
<t>
   This document is currently disorganized in order to minimize the changes
   between drafts and enable reviewers to see the smaller errata changes.
   The next draft will reorganize the sections to better reflect the content.
   In particular, the sections will be ordered according to the typical
   processing of an HTTP request message (after message parsing): resource
   mapping, general header fields, methods, request modifiers, response
   status, and resource metadata.  The current mess reflects how widely
   dispersed these topics and associated requirements had become in
   <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
</t>

<section title="Requirements" anchor="intro.requirements">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the &MUST; or &REQUIRED; level requirements for the protocols it
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the &MUST; or &REQUIRED;
   level and all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its protocols is said
   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the &MUST;
   level requirements but not all the &SHOULD; level requirements for its
   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

<t>
  This specification uses the ABNF syntax defined in &notation; (which
  extends the syntax defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/> with a list rule).
  <xref target="collected.abnf"/> shows the collected ABNF, with the list
  rule expanded.
</t>
<t>
  The following core rules are included by
  reference, as defined in <xref target="RFC5234" x:fmt="," x:sec="B.1"/>:
  ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls),
  DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE (double quote),
  HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed),
  OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space),
  VCHAR (any visible USASCII character),
  and WSP (whitespace).

   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET

<t>
   HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
   to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications &MUST;
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
   x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
   unrecognized response &MUST-NOT; be cached. For example, if an
   unrecognized status code of 431 is received by the client, it can
   safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and
   treat the response as if it had received a 400 status code. In such
   cases, user agents &SHOULD; present to the user the entity returned
   with the response, since that entity is likely to include human-readable
   information which will explain the unusual status.

<section title="Identifying the Resource Associated with a Representation" anchor="identifying.response.associated.with.representation">
<t>
   It is sometimes necessary to determine the identity of the resource
   associated with a representation.
</t>
<t>
   An HTTP request representation, when present, is always associated with an
   anonymous (i.e., unidentified) resource.
</t>
<t>
   In the common case, an HTTP response is a representation of the resource
   located at the request-URI. However, this is not always the case. To
   determine the URI of the resource a response is associated with, the
   following rules are used (first match winning):
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
   <t>If the response status code is 200 or 203 and the request method was GET,
   the response is a representation of the resource at the request-URI.</t>
   <t>If the response status is 204, 206, or 304 and the request method was GET
   or HEAD, the response is a partial representation of the resource at the
   request-URI (see &caching-combining-headers;).</t>
   <t>If the response has a Content-Location header, and that URI is the same
   as the request-URI <cref>(see [ref])</cref>, the response is a representation of the
   resource at the request-URI.</t>
   <t>If the response has a Content-Location header, and that URI is not the
   same as the request-URI, the response asserts that it is a representation of
   the resource at the Content-Location URI (but it may not be).</t>
   <t>Otherwise, the response is a representation of an anonymous (i.e.,
   unidentified) resource.</t>
</list></t>
<t>
  <cref anchor="TODO-req-uri">
   Note that 'request-URI' is used here; however, we need to come up with a
   term to denote "the URI that can be inferred from examining the
   request-target and the Host header." (see <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/196" />).
   Also, the comparison function is going to have to be defined somewhere,
   because we already need to compare URIs for things like cache invalidation.</cref>

<section title="Method Definitions" anchor="method.definitions">
<t>
   The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below. Although
   this set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to
   share the same semantics for separately extended clients and servers.
</t>

<section title="Safe and Idempotent Methods" anchor="safe.and.idempotent">

<section title="Safe Methods" anchor="safe.methods">
<iref item="Safe Methods" primary="true"/>
<t>
   Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in
   their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow
   the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an
   unexpected significance to themselves or others.
</t>
<t>
   In particular, the convention has been established that the GET, HEAD,
   OPTIONS, and TRACE methods &SHOULD-NOT;  have the significance of taking an action
   other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "<x:dfn anchor="safe">safe</x:dfn>".
   This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT
   and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the
   fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
</t>
<t>
   Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
   generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in
   fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important
   distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects,
   so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Idempotent Methods" anchor="idempotent.methods">
<iref item="Idempotent Methods" primary="true"/>
<t>
   Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that, aside
   from error or expiration issues, the intended effect of multiple
   identical requests is the same as for a single request.
   The methods PUT, DELETE, and all safe methods are idempotent.
   It is important to note that idempotence refers only to changes
   requested by the client: a server is free to change its state due
   to multiple requests for the purpose of tracking those requests,
   versioning of results, etc.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="OPTIONS" anchor="OPTIONS">
  <rdf:Description>
    <safe xmlns="urn:ietf:id:draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#">yes</safe>
  </rdf:Description>
  <iref primary="true" item="OPTIONS method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="OPTIONS" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the
   communication options available on the request/response chain
   identified by the request-target. This method allows the client to
   determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,
   or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action
   or initiating a resource retrieval.
</t>
<t>
   Responses to this method are not cacheable.
</t>
<t>
   If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the
   presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type
   &MUST; be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this
   specification does not define any use for such a body, future
   extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed
   queries on the server.
</t>
<t>
   If the request-target is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is
   intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific
   resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on
   the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op"
   type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test
   the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test
   a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).
</t>
<t>
   If the request-target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
   only to the options that are available when communicating with that
   resource.
</t>
<t>
   A 200 response &SHOULD; include any header fields that indicate
   optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that
   resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by
   this specification. The response body, if any, &SHOULD; also include
   information about the communication options. The format for such a
   body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by
   future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation &MAY; be used to select
   the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the
   response &MUST; include a Content-Length field with a field-value of
   "0".
</t>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards request-header field &MAY; be used to target a
   specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS
   request on an absolute-URI for which request forwarding is permitted,
   the proxy &MUST; check for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards
   field-value is zero ("0"), the proxy &MUST-NOT; forward the message;
   instead, the proxy &SHOULD; respond with its own communication options.
   If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the
   proxy &MUST; decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If
   no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded
   request &MUST-NOT; include a Max-Forwards field.

  <iref primary="true" item="GET method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="GET" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
   entity) is identified by the request-target.
</t>
<t>   
   If the request-target refers to a data-producing process, it is the
   produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not
   the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of
   the process.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
   request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
   If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
   method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
   circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
   conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network
   usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring
   multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.
</t>
<t>
   The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the
   request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
   that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in &header-range;.
   The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
   network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be
   completed without transferring data already held by the client.
</t>
<t>
   The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets
   the requirements for HTTP caching described in &caching;.
</t>

  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="HEAD" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server &MUST-NOT;
   return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained
   in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request &SHOULD; be identical
   to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can
   be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the
   request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is
   often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,
   and recent modification.
</t>
<t>
   The response to a HEAD request &MAY; be cacheable in the sense that the
   information contained in the response &MAY; be used to update a
   previously cached entity from that resource. If the new field values
   indicate that the cached entity differs from the current entity (as
   would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag
   or Last-Modified), then the cache &MUST; treat the cache entry as
   stale.

<section title="POST" anchor="POST">
  <iref primary="true" item="POST method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="POST" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
   entity enclosed in the request as data to be processed by the resource
   identified by the request-target in the Request-Line. POST is designed
   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Annotation of existing resources;
    </t>
    <t>
        Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
        or similar group of articles;
    </t>
    <t>
        Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;
    </t>
    <t>
        Extending a database through an append operation.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
   server and is usually dependent on the request-target.
</t>
<t>
   The action performed by the POST method might not result in a
   resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200
   (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status,
   depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that
   describes the result.
</t>
<t>
   If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
   &SHOULD; be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the
   status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location
   header (see <xref target="header.location"/>).
</t>
<t>
   Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response
   includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However,
   the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to
   retrieve a cacheable resource.
</t>
</section>

<section title="PUT" anchor="PUT">
  <iref primary="true" item="PUT method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="PUT" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored at the
   supplied request-target. If the request-target refers to an already
   existing resource, the enclosed entity &SHOULD; be considered as a
   modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the
   request-target does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is
   capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user
   agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a
   new resource is created at the request-target, the origin server &MUST;
   inform the user agent
   via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified,
   either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes &SHOULD; be sent
   to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource
   could not be created or modified with the request-target, an appropriate
   error response &SHOULD; be given that reflects the nature of the
   problem. The recipient of the entity &MUST-NOT; ignore any Content-*
   headers (headers starting with the prefix 'Content-') that it does
   not understand or implement
   and &MUST; return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.
</t>
<t>
   If the request passes through a cache and the request-target identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries &SHOULD; be
   treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.
</t>
<t>
   The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is
   reflected in the different meaning of the request-target. The URI in a
   POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed
   entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to
   some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.
   In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed
   with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the
   server &MUST-NOT; attempt to apply the request to some other resource.
   If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI,
   it &MUST; send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent &MAY;
   then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   A single resource &MAY; be identified by many different URIs. For
   example, an article might have a URI for identifying "the current
   version" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular
   version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in
   several other URIs being defined by the origin server.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an
   origin server.
</t>
<t>
   Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the
   entity-headers in the PUT request &SHOULD; be applied to the resource
   created or modified by the PUT.
</t>

<section title="DELETE" anchor="DELETE">
  <iref primary="true" item="DELETE method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="DELETE" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource
   identified by the request-target. This method &MAY; be overridden by human
   intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot
   be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
   status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action
   has been completed successfully. However, the server &SHOULD-NOT; 
   indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it
   intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible
   location.
</t>
<t>
   A successful response &SHOULD; be 200 (OK) if the response includes an
   entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not
   yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted
   but the response does not include an entity.
</t>
<t>
   If the request passes through a cache and the request-target identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries &SHOULD; be
   treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

  <iref primary="true" item="TRACE method" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Methods" subitem="TRACE" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop-back
   of the request message. The final recipient of the request
   &SHOULD; reflect the message received back to the client as the
   entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. The final recipient is either the
   origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards
   value of zero (0) in the request (see <xref target="header.max-forwards"/>). A TRACE request
   &MUST-NOT; include an entity.
</t>
<t>
   TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other
   end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic
   information. The value of the Via header field (&header-via;) is of
   particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the request chain.
   Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit the
   length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of
   proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop.
</t>
<t>
   If the request is valid, the response &SHOULD; contain the entire
   request message in the entity-body, with a Content-Type of
   "message/http" (see &media-type-message-http;). Responses to this method
   &MUST-NOT; be cached.

   Each Status-Code is described below, including any metainformation required

<section title="Informational 1xx" anchor="status.1xx">
<t>
   This class of status code indicates a provisional response,
   consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is
   terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this
   class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status
   codes, servers &MUST-NOT; send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client
   except under experimental conditions.
</t>
<t>
   A client &MUST; be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses
   prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100
   (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses &MAY; be
   ignored by a user agent.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies &MUST; forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the
   proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself
   requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a
   proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request,
   then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue)
   response(s).)
</t>

<section title="100 Continue" anchor="status.100">
  <iref primary="true" item="100 Continue (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="100 Continue" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The client &SHOULD; continue with its request. This interim response is
   used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has
   been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client
   &SHOULD; continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the
   request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server
   &MUST; send a final response after the request has been completed. See
   &use100; for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this
   status code.

  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="101 Switching Protocols" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's
   request, via the Upgrade message header field (&header-upgrade;), for a
   change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The
   server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's
   Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which
   terminates the 101 response.
</t>
<t>
   The protocol &SHOULD; be switched only when it is advantageous to do
   so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous
   over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous
   protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use
   such features.

  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="201 Created" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being
   created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s)
   returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI
   for the resource given by a Location header field. The response
   &SHOULD; include an entity containing a list of resource
   characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can
   choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by
   the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin
   server &MUST; create the resource before returning the 201 status code.
   If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server &SHOULD;
   respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.
</t>
<t>
   A 201 response &MAY; contain an ETag response header field indicating
   the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just

  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="202 Accepted" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has
   not been completed.  The request might or might not eventually be
   acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes
   place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an
   asynchronous operation such as this.
</t>
<t>
   The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to
   allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a
   batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without
   requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist
   until the process is completed. The entity returned with this
   response &SHOULD; include an indication of the request's current status
   and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the
   user can expect the request to be fulfilled.

<t>
   The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the
   definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered
   from a local or a third-party copy. The set presented &MAY; be a subset
   or superset of the original version. For example, including local
   annotation information about the resource might result in a superset
   of the metainformation known by the origin server. Use of this
   response code is not required and is only appropriate when the
   response would otherwise be 200 (OK).
</t>
</section>

<section title="204 No Content" anchor="status.204">
  <iref primary="true" item="204 No Content (status code)" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <iref primary="true" item="Status Codes" subitem="204 No Content" x:for-anchor=""/>
<t>
   The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an
   entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The
   response &MAY; include new or updated metainformation in the form of
   entity-headers, which if present &SHOULD; be associated with the
   requested variant.
</t>
<t>
   If the client is a user agent, it &SHOULD-NOT;  change its document view
   from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is
   primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without
   causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although
   any new or updated metainformation &SHOULD; be applied to the document
   currently in the user agent's active view.

<t>
   The 204 response &MUST-NOT; include a message-body, and thus is always

    specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the
    redirected request.  However, most existing user agent implementations
    treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location
    field-value regardless of the original request method. Therefore, a 
    previous version of this specification
    (<xref target="RFC2616" x:fmt="," x:sec="10.3.3"/>) has added the

    <xref target="status.303" format="none">303</xref> and

<t>
   The server directs the user agent to a different resource, indicated
   by a URI in the Location header field, that provides an indirect
   response to the original request.  The user agent &MAY; perform a GET
   request on the URI in the Location field in order to obtain a
   representation corresponding to the response, be redirected again,
   or end with an error status.  The Location URI is not a substitute
   reference for the originally requested resource.
</t>
<t>
   The 303 status is generally applicable to any HTTP method.  It is
   primarily used to allow the output of a POST action to redirect
   the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the
   information corresponding to the POST response in a form that
   can be separately identified, bookmarked, and cached independent
   of the original request.
</t>
<t>
   A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the requested
   resource does not have a representation of its own that can be
   transferred by the server over HTTP.  The Location URI indicates a
   resource that is descriptive of the requested resource such that
   the follow-on representation may be useful without implying that
   it adequately represents the previously requested resource.
   Note that answers to the questions of what can be represented, what
   representations are adequate, and what might be a useful description
   are outside the scope of HTTP and thus entirely determined by the
   URI owner(s).
</t>
<t>
   A 303 response &SHOULD-NOT; be cached unless it is indicated as
   cacheable by Cache-Control or Expires header fields.  Except for
   responses to a HEAD request, the entity of a 303 response &SHOULD;
   contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the Location URI.

   The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
   Since the redirection &MAY; be altered on occasion, the client &SHOULD;
   continue to use the request-target for future requests.  This response
   is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header
   field.
</t>
<t>
   The temporary URI &SHOULD; be given by the Location field in the
   response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
   response &SHOULD; contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
   the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not
   understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note &SHOULD; contain the
   information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on

   User agents &SHOULD; display any included entity to the user.

   If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP
   &SHOULD; be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of
   the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the
   input connection. If the client continues sending data to the server
   after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to
   the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers
   before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.

<t>
   The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
   state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where
   it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict
   and resubmit the request. The response body &SHOULD; include enough
   information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.
   Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the
   user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be
   possible and is not required.
</t>
<t>
   Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
   example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT
   included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
   earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
   to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the
   response entity would likely contain a list of the differences
   between the two versions in a format defined by the response
   Content-Type.

   The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no
   forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be
   considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities &SHOULD;
   delete references to the request-target after user approval. If the
   server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not
   the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) &SHOULD; be
   used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.
</t>
<t>
   The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web
   maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is
   intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that
   remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for
   limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to
   individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not
   necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or
   to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the

<t>
   A server that does not understand or is unable to comply with any of
   the expectation values in the Expect field of a request &MUST; respond
   with appropriate error status. The server &MUST; respond with a 417
   (Expectation Failed) status if any of the expectations cannot be met
   or, if there are other problems with the request, some other 4xx
   status.
</t>
<t>
   This header field is defined with extensible syntax to allow for
   future extensions. If a server receives a request containing an
   Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not
   support, it &MUST; respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.
</t>
<t>
   Comparison of expectation values is case-insensitive for unquoted
   tokens (including the 100-continue token), and is case-sensitive for
   quoted-string expectation-extensions.
</t>
<t>
   The Expect mechanism is hop-by-hop: that is, an HTTP/1.1 proxy &MUST;
   return a 417 (Expectation Failed) status if it receives a request
   with an expectation that it cannot meet. However, the Expect
   request-header itself is end-to-end; it &MUST; be forwarded if the
   request is forwarded.
</t>
<t>
   Many older HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 applications do not understand the
   Expect header.
</t>
<t>
   See &use100; for the use of the 100 (Continue) status.

<t>
   This header field &MAY; be used for logging purposes and as a means for
   identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests. It &SHOULD-NOT; 
   be used as an insecure form of access protection. The interpretation
   of this field is that the request is being performed on behalf of the
   person given, who accepts responsibility for the method performed. In
   particular, robot agents &SHOULD; include this header so that the
   person responsible for running the robot can be contacted if problems
   occur on the receiving end.
</t>
<t>
   The Internet e-mail address in this field &MAY; be separate from the
   Internet host which issued the request. For example, when a request
   is passed through a proxy the original issuer's address &SHOULD; be
   used.
</t>
<t>
   The client &SHOULD-NOT;  send the From header field without the user's
   approval, as it might conflict with the user's privacy interests or
   their site's security policy. It is strongly recommended that the
   user be able to disable, enable, and modify the value of this field
   at any time prior to a request.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Location"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Location-v"/>
<t>
   The "Location" response-header field is used to identify a newly created
   resource, or to redirect the recipient to a different location for
   completion of the request.
</t>
<t>
   For 201 (Created) responses, the Location is the URI of the new resource
   which was created by the request. For 3xx responses, the location &SHOULD;
   indicate the server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the
   resource.
</t>
<t>
   The field value consists of a single URI.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Location"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Location-v"/>
  <x:ref>Location</x:ref>       = "Location" ":" <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> <x:ref>Location-v</x:ref>
  <x:ref>Location-v</x:ref>     = <x:ref>URI</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   An example is:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Location: http://www.example.org/pub/WWW/People.html
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   There are circumstances in which a fragment identifier in a Location URI would not be appropriate:
   <list style="symbols">
      <t>With a 201 Created response, because in this usage the Location header specifies the URI for the entire created resource.</t>
      <t>With 305 Use Proxy.</t>
   </list>
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> The Content-Location header field (&header-content-location;) differs
    from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original
    location of the entity enclosed in the response. It is therefore
    possible for a response to contain header fields for both Location
    and Content-Location.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Max-Forwards"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Max-Forwards-v"/>
<t>
   The "Max-Forwards" request-header field provides a mechanism with the
   TRACE (<xref target="TRACE"/>) and OPTIONS (<xref target="OPTIONS"/>)
   methods to limit the number of times that the request is forwarded by
   proxies or gateways. This can be useful when the client is attempting to
   trace a request which appears to be failing or looping in mid-chain.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Max-Forwards"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Max-Forwards-v"/>

  <x:ref>Max-Forwards-v</x:ref> = 1*<x:ref>DIGIT</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining
   number of times this request message may be forwarded.
</t>
<t>
   Each proxy or gateway recipient of a TRACE or OPTIONS request
   containing a Max-Forwards header field &MUST; check and update its
   value prior to forwarding the request. If the received value is zero
   (0), the recipient &MUST-NOT; forward the request; instead, it &MUST;
   respond as the final recipient. If the received Max-Forwards value is
   greater than zero, then the forwarded message &MUST; contain an updated
   Max-Forwards field with a value decremented by one (1).
</t>
<t>
   The Max-Forwards header field &MAY; be ignored for all other methods
   defined by this specification and for any extension methods for which
   it is not explicitly referred to as part of that method definition.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Referer"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Referer-v"/>
<t>
   The "Referer" [sic] request-header field allows the client to specify the
   URI of the resource from which the request-target was obtained (the
   "referrer", although the header field is misspelled.).
</t>
<t>
   The Referer header allows servers to generate lists of back-links to
   resources for interest, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows
   obsolete or mistyped links to be traced for maintenance. Some servers use
   Referer as a means of controlling where they allow links from (so-called
   "deep linking"), but it should be noted that legitimate requests are not
   required to contain a Referer header field.
</t>
<t>
   If the request-target was obtained from a source that does not have its own
   URI (e.g., input from the user keyboard), the Referer field MUST either be
   sent with the value "about:blank", or not be sent at all. Note that this
   requirement does not apply to sources with non-HTTP URIs (e.g., FTP).
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Referer"/><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Referer-v"/>
  <x:ref>Referer</x:ref>        = "Referer" ":" <x:ref>OWS</x:ref> <x:ref>Referer-v</x:ref>
  <x:ref>Referer-v</x:ref>      = <x:ref>absolute-URI</x:ref> / <x:ref>partial-URI</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Example:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Referer: http://www.example.org/hypertext/Overview.html
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   If the field value is a relative URI, it &SHOULD; be interpreted
   relative to the request-target. The URI &MUST-NOT; include a fragment. See
   <xref target="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris"/> for security considerations.

  <x:anchor-alias value="Retry-After"/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Retry-After-v"/>
<t>
   The response-header "Retry-After" field can be used with a 503 (Service
   Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to
   be unavailable to the requesting client. This field &MAY; also be used
   with any 3xx (Redirection) response to indicate the minimum time the
   user-agent is asked wait before issuing the redirected request.
</t>
<t>
   The value of this field can be either an HTTP-date or an integer number
   of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the response.

   The "Server" response-header field contains information about the
   software used by the origin server to handle the request.
</t>
<t>
   The field can contain multiple product tokens (&product-tokens;) and
   comments (&header-fields;) identifying the server and any significant
   subproducts. The product tokens are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.

   If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy
   application &MUST-NOT; modify the Server response-header. Instead, it
   &MUST; include a Via field (as described in &header-via;).
</t>
<x:note>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h> Revealing the specific software version of the server might
    allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks

   The "User-Agent" request-header field contains information about the
   user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes,
   the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user
   agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user
   agent limitations.
</t>

   User agents &SHOULD; include this field with requests. The field can contain

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<t>
   This section is meant to inform application developers, information
   providers, and users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1 as
   described by this document. The discussion does not include
   definitive solutions to the problems revealed, though it does make
   some suggestions for reducing security risks.
</t>

<section title="Transfer of Sensitive Information" anchor="security.sensitive">
<t>
   Like any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the
   content of the data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori
   method of determining the sensitivity of any particular piece of
   information within the context of any given request. Therefore,
   applications &SHOULD; supply as much control over this information as
   possible to the provider of that information. Four header fields are
   worth special mention in this context: Server, Via, Referer and From.
</t>
<t>
   Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the
   server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software
   that is known to contain security holes. Implementors &SHOULD; make the
   Server header field a configurable option.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall &SHOULD;
   take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information
   that identifies the hosts behind the firewall. In particular, they
   &SHOULD; remove, or replace with sanitized versions, any Via fields
   generated behind the firewall.
</t>
<t>
   The Referer header allows reading patterns to be studied and reverse
   links drawn. Although it can be very useful, its power can be abused
   if user details are not separated from the information contained in
   the Referer. Even when the personal information has been removed, the
   Referer header might indicate a private document's URI whose
   publication would be inappropriate.
</t>
<t>
   The information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's
   privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it
   &SHOULD-NOT;  be transmitted without the user being able to disable,
   enable, and modify the contents of the field. The user &MUST; be able
   to set the contents of this field within a user preference or
   application defaults configuration.
</t>
<t>
   We suggest, though do not require, that a convenient toggle interface
   be provided for the user to enable or disable the sending of From and
   Referer information.
</t>
<t>
   The User-Agent (<xref target="header.user-agent"/>) or Server (<xref target="header.server"/>) header
   fields can sometimes be used to determine that a specific client or
   server have a particular security hole which might be exploited.
   Unfortunately, this same information is often used for other valuable
   purposes for which HTTP currently has no better mechanism.
</t>
<t>
   Some methods, like TRACE (<xref target="TRACE"/>) may expose 
   information sent in request headers in the response entity. 
   Clients &SHOULD; be careful with sensitive information, like Cookies, 
   Authorization credentials and other headers that might be used to 
   collect data from the client.
</t> 
</section>

<section title="Encoding Sensitive Information in URIs" anchor="encoding.sensitive.information.in.uris">
<t>
   Because the source of a link might be private information or might
   reveal an otherwise private information source, it is strongly
   recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the
   Referer field is sent. For example, a browser client could have a
   toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would
   respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From
   information.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &SHOULD-NOT; include a Referer header field in a (non-secure)
   HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure
   protocol.
</t>
<t>
   Authors of services should not use
   GET-based forms for the submission of sensitive data because that
   data will be encoded in the Request-target. Many existing
   servers, proxies, and user agents log or display the Request-target in
   places where it might be visible to third parties. Such services can
   use POST-based form submission instead.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Location Headers and Spoofing" anchor="location.spoofing">
<t>
   If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust
   one another, then it &MUST; check the values of Location and Content-Location
   headers in responses that are generated under control of
   said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to
   invalidate resources over which they have no authority.

<section title="Compatibility with Previous Versions" anchor="compatibility">
<section title="Changes from RFC 2068" anchor="changes.from.rfc.2068">
<t>
   Clarified which error code should be used for inbound server failures
   (e.g. DNS failures). (<xref target="status.504"/>).
</t>
<t>
   201 (Created) had a race that required an Etag be sent when a resource is
   first created. (<xref target="status.201"/>).
</t>
<t>
   303 (See Also) and 307 (Temporary Redirect) added to address user agent
   failure to implement status code 302 properly.
   (Section <xref target="status.303" format="counter"/> and <xref target="status.307" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   Rewrite of message transmission requirements to make it much harder
   for implementors to get it wrong, as the consequences of errors here
   can have significant impact on the Internet, and to deal with the
   following problems:
  <list style="numbers">
      <t>Changing "HTTP/1.1 or later" to "HTTP/1.1", in contexts where
         this was incorrectly placing a requirement on the behavior of
         an implementation of a future version of HTTP/1.x</t>

      <t>Made it clear that user-agents should retry requests, not
         "clients" in general.</t>

      <t>Converted requirements for clients to ignore unexpected 100
         (Continue) responses, and for proxies to forward 100 responses,
         into a general requirement for 1xx responses.</t>

      <t>Modified some TCP-specific language, to make it clearer that
         non-TCP transports are possible for HTTP.</t>

      <t>Require that the origin server &MUST-NOT; wait for the request
         body before it sends a required 100 (Continue) response.</t>

      <t>Allow, rather than require, a server to omit 100 (Continue) if
         it has already seen some of the request body.</t>

      <t>Allow servers to defend against denial-of-service attacks and
         broken clients.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This change adds the Expect header and 417 status code.
</t>
<t>
   Clean up confusion between 403 and 404 responses. (Section <xref target="status.403" format="counter"/>,
   <xref target="status.404" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="status.410" format="counter"/>)
</t>
<t>
   The PATCH<iref item="PATCH method" primary="true"/><iref item="Methods" subitem="PATCH" primary="true"/>, LINK<iref item="LINK method" primary="true"/><iref item="Methods" subitem="LINK" primary="true"/>, UNLINK<iref item="UNLINK method" primary="true"/><iref item="Methods" subitem="UNLINK" primary="true"/> methods were defined but not commonly
   implemented in previous versions of this specification. See <xref target="RFC2068" x:fmt="of" x:sec="19.6.1"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes from RFC 2616" anchor="changes.from.rfc.2616">
<t>
  This document takes over the Status Code Registry, previously defined
  in <xref target="RFC2817" x:fmt="of" x:sec="7.1"/>.
  (<xref target="status.code.registry"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Clarify definition of POST.
  (<xref target="POST"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Failed to consider that there are
  many other request methods that are safe to automatically redirect,
  and further that the user agent is able to make that determination
  based on the request method semantics.
  (Sections <xref format="counter" target="status.301"/>,
  <xref format="counter" target="status.302"/> and
  <xref format="counter" target="status.307"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Deprecate 305 Use Proxy status code, because user agents did not implement it.
  It used to indicate that the requested resource must be accessed through the
  proxy given by the Location field. The Location field gave the URI of the
  proxy. The recipient was expected to repeat this single request via the proxy.
  (<xref target="status.305"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Reclassify Allow header as response header, removing the option to
  specify it in a PUT request.
  Relax the server requirement on the contents of the Allow header and
  remove requirement on clients to always trust the header value.
  (<xref target="header.allow"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Correct syntax of Location header to allow fragment,
  as referred symbol wasn't what was expected, and add some
  clarifications as to when it would not be appropriate.
  (<xref target="header.location"/>)
</t>
<t>
  Allow Referer value of "about:blank" as alternative to not specifying it. 
  (<xref target="header.referer"/>)
</t>
<t>
  In the description of the Server header, the Via field
  was described as a SHOULD. The requirement was and is stated
  correctly in the description of the Via header in &header-via;.
  (<xref target="header.server"/>)
</t>
